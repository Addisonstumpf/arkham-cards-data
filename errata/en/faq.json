			"question": "Is the “pile of potential sacrifices”in play or out of play? Are they under any player’s control? What about cards that have been placed underneath the agenda deck?",
			"answer": "The “pile of potential sacrifices” (and cards underneath the agenda deck) should be considered to be in play for the purposes of game rules, but these cards are under no player’s control. (Since the cards are facedown, you should try to remember which unique allies were kidnapped and added to the pile of potential sacrifices without having to look at it.) Additionally, the cards in the pile of potential sacrifices and underneath the agenda deck cannot be affected by player card effects or investigator actions.\nThus, if a unique asset is Kidnapped!, an investigator cannot play another copy of that asset. Additionally, if a player resigns or is defeated, any cards he or she owns that are in the pile of potential sacrifices or facedown underneath the agenda deck will remain as such."

If for whatever reason Duke cannot be included in “Ashcan” Pete’s deck, that requirement is considered to be removed, and Pete may continue without Duke.\nOf course, since this is a significant handicap, you may also choose to optionally retire Pete and continue using a new investigator at 0 experience"
