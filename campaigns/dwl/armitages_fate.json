When you arrive, you find that the latches of his front door have been busted open, and his living area and study have been ransacked. Dr. Armitage is nowhere to be found. Searching his home, you find a journal the intruders didn’t steal tucked beneath several other documents in the bottom drawer of Armitage’s desk.\nThe journal appears to be written in a strange language you cannot decode, using a script you’ve never seen in your entire life.

He is grateful to you for searching for his colleagues, but he doesn’t look relieved. With a long pause, he straightens his glasses and explains:\n“I’m afraid I must apologize. There’s something I didn’t mention to you earlier.” Dr. Armitage then spins a tale you would scarcely believe had it not been for your harrowing experiences earlier that night…"
