But here, we have proof.\"\nTogether, you and Professor Day Morris complete your forensic analysis and present your findings to a grateful Icelandic Historical Society. You leverage your success into a permanent position at the Culture House where you teach the truth about Egil, the bad and the good in equal measure. But above all, you are compelled to be <i>near</i> the hideous skull. To <i>watch</i> it… to <i>protect</i> it… <i>forever</i>…"

It must be destroyed.\nDespite the frigid cold of the cliff side, you remove your jacket and begin to carve a series of runes into your arms. The snow catches the drops of blood in silence, creating a constellation of red.\nProfessor Day Morris looks at you in abject terror, but before she can turn away, the surrounding mist swirls into a maelstrom, tossing up a blinding sheet of snow.\nWhen the storm settles, the mist has entirely dissipated. The skull is nowhere to be seen. The souls of the fallen can finally rest."
