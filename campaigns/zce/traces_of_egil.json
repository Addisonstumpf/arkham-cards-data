I mean to have these chests carried to the Hill of Laws just when it is most crowded. Then I mean to sow broadcast the silver, and I shall be surprized if all share it fairly between them. Kicks, I fancy, there will be and blows; nay, it may end in a general fight of all the assembled Thing.\"\nToo frail to attend himself, Egil had the silver buried, then murdered the slaves he hired to ensure it never be found."
