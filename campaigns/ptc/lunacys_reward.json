The answers to all of your questions might lie inside. Cautiously, you open the front door to the manor once again. Reassuring jazz and the clamor of casual conversation grow louder as you step inside. The enticing smell of roasted pork wafts through the air. As you suspected, the signs of struggle and oddities you noticed before have vanished without explanation. Then, as you turn the corner into the dining room, you find the Stranger speaking with another man—tall, mustached, wearing a fine black suit, and holding a silver-handled cane. The Stranger turns to you, his gaze drills through your mind, and your vision swims with agony. Before you realize it, you are running as fast as you can, toppling through the front doorway in a haze of pain and disorientation. Without time to catch your breath, you race to your vehicle and speed away, hands trembling upon the steering wheel.",

You hope it’s enough, but you aren’t willing to stick around to find out. As soon as you’re done, you head back to your vehicle and drive toward Southside, where you hope to find answers.",

You root through the open garage for a few supplies, finding an old hose, an empty gasoline canister, and some matches. Knowing what you must do, you first siphon some gas from Mrs. Dumaine’s Oakland 6-54A. You spread the gasoline across the front porch, inside the garage, and around the manor’s outer walls. From there, all it takes is several matches to start the blaze. You watch from the front yard as the manor is eventually consumed by the flames. The sounds of crackling fire and snapping wood and the screeching of dying horrors fills the street. Satisfied, you head back to your vehicle and tear off toward Southside, full of grim determination.",
