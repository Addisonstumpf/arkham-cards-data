Does she speak for you? Or for herself, as well?\nIchtaca rises to her feet after some time. “I trust you to take the first watch. Be on the lookout for serpents. They are surely on the lookout for us.” Your camp is quiet for the remainder of the night, but for the soothing crackling of the campfire and the choir of chirping insects whose singing fills the night air."
