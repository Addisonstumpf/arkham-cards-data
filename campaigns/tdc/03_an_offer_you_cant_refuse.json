It is a vaguely humanoid figure, sitting in a stooped position, with a heavy, octopoid head and squid-like features. There is something malevolent in its expression, something unwholesome in the very way it was sculpted. You find it difficult to look away."

He describes a record of some ancient cosmic struggle, and how he believes that all of earth is on the cusp of an apocalypse, much like the one that destroyed the statue's creator.\nIn all of human history—in every separate mythology—there exists a story of a great flood. A cataclysm. There are legends of a great city-state: a bastion of knowledge and might, that sank beneath the waves. Humankind has named it many things. Atlantis. Mu. Lemuria. But its true name, a name that predates history, is <b><i>R’lyeh</i></b>.\n\"Through much painstaking research, and the assistance of a mad sailor named Gustaf, I have pinpointed the relative coordinates of the ancient city. A stretch of ocean in the South Pacific where many sailing vessels have shipwrecked or disappeared with no explanation. Which brings me to my offer. I need someone bold and resourceful to lead an expedition to the ancient city. Someone to bring back evidence of its ancient knowledge, study its secrets, record its wonders. I need that person to be you\" Randall says, looking to you, then to Ruby and Andy.\n\"Should you accept, I shall absolve you of any remaining debt and provide you enough money to retire comfortably. <i>Very</i> comfortably. And, of course, lend my assistance for your <i>other</i> concerns.\"\nYour mind wanders back to those other \"concerns.\""

I assure you this will change <i>everything.</i>\"\nAfter Andy negotiates for a comprehensive supply of film, and Ruby ups her commission,Tillinghast outlines the plan for the expedition. Tomorrow, a train will take you to San Francisco, where the <i>Cassandra</i> will sail you down to the provided coordinates in the South Pacific. There is an excited, almost childlike glee as the antiquarian outlines the details. \"I've sent supplies enough to last the entire expedition several months if needed.
