Inspector Legrasse shouts to his fellow officers, goading them to not let up. Great Cthulhu moans in pain as the sheer firepower chews through his armored flesh, flooding the streets with only black blood. At long last, the tide seems to have turned in your favor. Cowed by the relentless assault, the ancient one turns back to the Miskatonic and lurches into the water, followed by a cadre of monstrous creatures.\nYou can feel the others hold their breath, waiting for some reprisal, but nothing comes.
