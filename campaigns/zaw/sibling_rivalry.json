      "text": "The places in Wonderland where the fields and trees meet tend to spark the greatest suspicion in you.  The illusion of safety in the wide plains makes the darkened forests look all the more sinister.  Shadows flit around every fallen log and bed of moss, making each step forward a nervous one.  Where will Gurathnaka's hungry minions strike from this time?  As if to answer your question, a pair of dark claws extend from a rotted stump, but before you can beat them back, a shaking sound echoes from within the woods, and the shadows retreat.  Curiosity strikes you at the swift result, and you head a little deeper into the woods to find the source of the noise.\nEven after what you've seen in Wonderland, the sight that greets you seems far-fetched.  Two rotund figures of indeterminate age stand in a clearing, fighting back and forth over a small object.  It takes a moment of observation before it occurs to you that the two look exactly like Tweedledum and Tweedledee from the old nursery rhyme.  They're currently tussling with each other over a toy rattle, which you quickly identify as the source of the strange noise from before.  You look to the edges of the clearing and confirm that each wild shake of the rattle causes the creeping shadows to shrink away.  Strange as it seems, it may help your mission to get that rattle.\nYou step closer to the two and try to interject, but the twins look to you indignantly.  \"It's rude to interrupt!\" Tweedledee snaps at you with a sneer.  \"Contrariwise, it's polite to say nothing at all!\" Tweedledum chimes in.  They ignore your attempts at reasoning and bargaining as they return to their tug-of-war.  \"It's my rattle and I shan't let you take it!\" Tweedledum grunts at his brother.  \"You've had your fun!  It's my turn now!\" Tweedledee spits back.  The two pull on the rattle until a wooden crack echoes out, and each collapses back with half of it.  \"You broke it!\" Tweedledum cries out, though his brother shakes his head and sneers \"Didn't!\"  The pair storm off before you can intervene or mediate, shouting threats of war at each other.\nYou sigh in irritation.  At first you consider just snatching the pieces of the rattle away from them, but your plan is quickly stifled by the sudden appearance of two massive armies of figures.  One battalion is made of living playing cards, and the other of living chess pieces, each siding with one of the Tweedles, who are busy strapping household objects to themselves for protection.  The Cheshire Cat appears between you with the same telltale grin, but a roll of his eyes.  \"Tweedledum and Tweedledee agreed to have a battle.  Surely you know the rest,\" it purrs as the combatants take places across a small wooded valley from each other.  Once again, you've been caught up in the nonsense of Wonderland's strange citizens.  Still, if at all possible, you've got to get your hands on that rattle."
