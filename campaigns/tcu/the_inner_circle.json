We have defended against threats to our very existence. We have sacrificed everything for this sacred cause. Now, one of these threats terrorizes our city, and we are the only ones who can stop it. You know the creature I speak of.” You nod in affirmation.\n“Here is what we know: it was the witches who brought this abomination upon Arkham. We tried to stop their ritual, but unfortunately, we were unsuccessful in binding it. Now it is loose, and we must finish what we started before the witches are able to do the same. But first, I understand you may have some information for us, as well. Please, hand over what you have found. It is important that we collaborate in order to understand this situation.”"

He clenches his jaw and glares at you for a moment, his cold blue eyes staring daggers into yours. “That is disappointing to hear. But perhaps it is my fault; I should not have imposed such a heavy burden on a neophyte to the Order.”\nMr. Sanford rises to his feet, and the other members of the Order follow suit. He addresses the other members of the Inner Circle: “All right. We have no more time to spare. The ritual must be completed at once. We shall use the same site as before—the central pillar of the Unvisited Isle, where the barrier between this world and the next is thinnest. It is likely that the anomaly will pursue us there, so act with caution.” Then he turns back to you. “We will require your assistance as well, of course. The device you hold is the key to binding the revenant. You must use it properly when the time comes. Do you understand?” You nod in affirmation. Taking a deep breath to steel your nerves, you prepare for the journey to the Unvisited Isle—a journey toward death itself."
