      "text": "It is a breezy November evening in Arkham—the perfect night for a walk through Independence Square, or so you had thought, up until the moment Anna Kaslow offered to tell your fortune. You agreed, though you would soon come to regret this decision. For each of the cards the Romani soothsayer draws from her deck, she weaves a tale of despair and misfortune. Judgment. Temperance. Justice. The Hermit. The Hanged Man. The Hierophant. The Lovers. The Chariot. The Wheel of Fortune. To complete her tale, Anna draws the top card and lays it in the center of the formation. Dominating the old, worn card is the ominous image of a towering construct of black onyx. A hellish storm rages over the tower, lightning coursing through the dark clouds. It reads: THE TOWER · XVI. Even if the rest of the reading had gone swimmingly, the sight of the center card would have sent a shiver down your spine. As it stands now, it feels more like the closing of a casket over your body.\n“You did tell me to give it to you straight,” the soothsayer says. She sits cross-legged in front of you, wearing a stony, grim expression. From her unwavering gaze and her cold eyes, you can tell Anna derives no satisfaction from this reading. “Simple misfortune is the least of your concerns,” she explains. “This is a matter of life and death.” She motions to the cards surrounding The Tower—each of them laid in the reverse position—and stares at them intently. “Arrayed against you is everything that you cannot see. You alone stand in their way,” she says enigmatically."
