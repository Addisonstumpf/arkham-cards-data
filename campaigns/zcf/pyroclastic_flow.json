With the travel warning and the worsening weather, you have difficulty finding any ships ready to leave port, much less travel to the Sunda Strait.  After several increasingly desperate hours, you finally meet a weathered fisherman named Sukiman who agrees to hear you out.  The old Indonesian man pays close attention as you speak, but seems to study you more than the words you say.  You offer Sukiman as much as you can, but he simply holds his hand up.  \"You must be truly desperate, or perhaps a fool,\" he muses, eyes still locked on you, \"but I trust that almighty God has sent you to me.  I will help you.\"\nYou waste no time in casting off from Singapore, setting immediate course for the Sunda Strait.  The days in transit give you time to prepare yourself and Sukiman for the ordeals ahead.  It's difficult to summarize your goal without sounding like a crackpot theorist, but the fisherman responds with a troubled look on his face.  \"There are a great many things in this world that I do not understand, but I understand the sea above all else.  It has been a companion to me through many long voyages, and I know its rhythm and swell like I know my own heartbeat.  Its rhythm has faltered.\"  Sukiman pauses, brow furled in concentration.  \"Only once before have I seen it falter, years ago when madness struck the artists of Singapore.  One drowned himself in the harbor beside my boat.  I can still remember his expression.  It was the same as yours when you first approached me, only filled with despair.  The madness stopped at the same time that the sea regained its rhythm, but I never forgot.  That is why I agreed to help you.  You know what has affected the sea, and you mean to stop it.  Again, I trust that God has brought you to me for this task, to return the seas to normal -- and perhaps much more.\"\nYou stand beside him in silence, contemplating his words and the burden that lies on your shoulders.  Preventing the rise of Cthulhu was not what you signed up for when you accepted Wycliffe's offer nearly two months ago, but the stakes are clear.  Stop the architects or the world will be embroiled in madness.  A sudden gasp from Sukiman rouses your attention, and he points ahead to the sea before the ship.  Unmistakably, the horizon is bending."

The torrent falls before you do, softening the impact but threatening to drown you as the water flows its disjointed course.
