At its current rate, this approaching storm will reach its full strength during your investigations.  Preferable as it would be to wait out the bad weather, each delay only reduces your chances of finding the missing cargo.\nYou step out into the streets of Arkham and pull your coat a little tighter as you review the information from Wycliffe once more.  The Mycenae expedition returned directly from Greece, and offloaded the cargo at Kingsport from the ocean liner to a cargo barge.  This barge was taken up the Miskatonic river by a towboat named the Myra Louise.  This towboat is the same one that delivered the previous expedition findings, and has been operating on the Miskatonic River for over twenty years without incident.  That doesn't change the fact, however, that the Myra Louise missed its scheduled arrival in Arkham last night and has not been seen since its departure from Kingsport.\nThe key to unraveling the cargo's disappearance and your own misgivings about Wycliffe's job for you both lie with finding the missing towboat.  You proceed from your house toward the river, guarding yourself against the elements with a curious feeling growing at the back of your mind.  An atmosphere of unease has settled over Arkham this evening, worse than the usual air of superstition.  Some of the people you pass act like sleepwalkers, barely conscious of their surroundings and talking to themselves in stilted bursts.  Others stare at you with suspicion and fear, only averting their eyes once you notice them.  And perhaps it's your imagination, but are there dark shapes moving in the river?"

The strongbox contains most of the paperwork concerning the ship's business, among which you find a manifest of the cargo taken for the Mycenae expedition.  When compared with the list that James Wycliffe included in his letter, you find some discrepancies, most notably sealed crates containing several tons of carved stone blocks.

False leads, dead ends and a lack of direct witnesses kept you running in circles long enough for the thugs, monsters, and elements to push you to your limit.  You beat a hasty retreat to Velma's Diner to recuperate and think of a new approach.  Black coffee soothes your body and mind all at once, and you sit silently thinking of where to try next.  Out of all the possibilities, only one checks all the boxes: the O'Bannion gang.  With the amount of riverfront property they control, their armed force to hijack the ship, and their capacity for threatening witnesses into silence, it's a likely – and dangerous – lead to follow.",

One memory in particular comes to mind, from when you first entered the ship, of the body in the expensive suit being dumped overboard.  The only possibility that reaches your mind is the O'Bannion gang.  Only a gangster would be that well-dressed at the scene of a crime.  Whether or not they were working with or against the other man on the ship, the O'Bannions were definitely involved, and the only way to sort out the mystery is to confront them directly.",

What you found on the ship provided just as many mysteries as answers, and you still don't feel much closer to recovering the expedition's stolen findings.  You do have an idea of where to search next, however, thanks to the brutish man you first clashed with on the ship.  When you approached, you saw him dumping a body in an expensive suit over the side of the ship.  Only a gangster would be that well-dressed at the scene of a crime, and only the O'Bannion gang would be so bold as to hijack a publicly celebrated expedition.  If anyone knows where the missing cargo is, it's those gangsters.  Your course is clear.",
