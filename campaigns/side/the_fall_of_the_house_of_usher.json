For years I have been acquainted with the Usher family — one of the earliest families to have emigrated from England, perhaps. Roderick and his sister Madeline are the last descendants of the Ushers. I haven't heard or talked to them in the better ‘part of two decades, but now, out of the blue, Roderick sends me a letter pleading for my personal help.\nTheir manor — the house of Usher, as it is called — is a morose place to be sure, but there has always been something unnatural about it, something that the Ushers have hidden for centuries. cannot find a single hint as to what that secret might be, but I'd stake my reputation on ere being something evil in that house. Evil enough that after ten generations, Roderick feels that he must act, or ask others to act if he cannot.\nHowever, I am not as fit as I once was, nor is this my area of expertise. Can I rely on you to expose this evil?”"
