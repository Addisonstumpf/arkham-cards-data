Paris, France.</fancy>\n<fancy>Dearest friend,</fancy>\n<fancy>I heard you've come to Paris and I am quite troubled you did not reach out to meet with me. It has been too long since our last supper. Alas, I am afraid I must ask you to visit the théâtre once more, this time not for our pleasantries. A week ago, I visited a new viol player in our theatre, a German fellow named Erich Zann. He became increasingly absent during the theatre's gatherings. The note which he finally handed me was an appeal for tolerance and forgiveness. Zann said that he was old, lonely, and afflicted with strange fears and nervous disorders connected with his music. Although he seemed genuine in intent, I could sense a horrible fear behind his eyes, and a chilling cold emanating from his window, as if someone—something were listening to use from outside. That was a few days before his disappearance. It may be selfish and irrational, but I now fear for the safety of the remainder of the orchestra. Come by the Auseil Theatre as soon as you have time, I will brief you on the details after our overdue greetings.</fancy>\n<fancy>-Votre vieil ami, Auguste Guadin</fancy>"
