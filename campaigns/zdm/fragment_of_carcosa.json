Several of the golden discs obtained from the Mi-Go must be placed in front -- aligned to form a syzygy. With the components in order, you pronounce the unspeakable message from Earth:\n<center>\"Let the red dawn surmise</center>\n<center>What we shall do,</center>\n<center>When this blue starlight dies</center>\n<center>And all is through.\"</center>\nThe golden discs begin trembling, building momentum until they all turn upright and begin to roll around the shrine in one direction. The quantum artifact's hue shifts into a yellow glare before glowing an intense and dense red. The discs spin around and around the surface at different, but consistent speeds, until they finally slow down to a crawl and fall over simultaneously. Then, as suddenly as it began, the red shard erupts in a fog of nebulous gas, blinding you in its flurry.\nWhen your eyesight returns, all that remains are the golden discs resting at various locations across the floor. You instinctively recognize this as a schematic of the solar system. Upon closer examination, a single remnant of the purple shard remains between what you believe is Jupiter and Saturn's orbits. K2-PS187 confirms that the depiction is accurate to the current star-time -- and begins plotting a course towards the asteroid.\nOn the way there, you think of the different worlds you have visited and many adventures you have experienced, both in this world and in your own. Throughout every interaction, every quest, is the underlying sense of hope and optimism for the future. This future does not deserve to become another pawn to the mad king, and you intend to stop that from happening.\nWhen you arrive, the asteroid does not resemble what you had expected. The egg-shaped asteroid is about 4 km at its widest, and looks awfully… normal. The yellow color is closer to a murky brown than gold. It is littered with craters and cavities, battered by the harshness of space. Without delay, you suit on and descend onto the surface of Fragment, ready to face the Royal Princess of Carcosa…"
