Such abilities are generally used to find story assets, story cards or locations in the scanning deck to help progress within each scenario, and are usually, but not always, initiated using the “activate” action.\n<b>Scan</b> abilities instruct you to search for the top card of the scanning deck matching a certain icon. In such cases, look at the icons on the bottom of the top card in the scanning deck. <b>If the top card of the scanning deck has an icon matching the icon you are scanning for, draw that card.</b> This is considered a “successful” scan. If no cards were drawn, the scan is considered to be \"unsuccessful\".\nIf the topmost card does not have a matching icon, place it face down next to the scanning deck, and look for a matching icon on the next card of the scanning deck. Repeat this process until a card of the indicated type is drawn. After this action has ended, shuffle each card next to the scanning deck back into the scanning deck.\n<b>Scan</b> abilities will usually, but not always, refer to the icon of a location. The icon of a location is the connection symbol that is located in the top left corner of the card.\nIf such a situation arises that you would need to discard a card with the scanning back or shuffle it into any other deck, shuffle it back into the scanning deck instead."
