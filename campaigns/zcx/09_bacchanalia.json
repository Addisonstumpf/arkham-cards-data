If there's any big organization dedicated to Shub-Niggurath, it has to be exclusive, perhaps even secretive to avoid any ignorant socialite joining them by mistake, and likely has some obvious connection only noticeable to those looking for it. One name among the newspapers catches your eye more than the others -- the Liber Pater Society.\nFrom what you can gather, the society is long-established with a reputation for hosting lavish affairs for the elite. Many a celebrity and millionaire have been denied membership, the papers eagerly tell, and committees for public morals have often denounced their libertine activities, but never to any real effect. The few pictures available of their weekly galas depict scenes of Roman decadence, connecting the old cult alibi with modern entertainment of Blake's caliber. You're in luck that the society meets on Sunday nights."
