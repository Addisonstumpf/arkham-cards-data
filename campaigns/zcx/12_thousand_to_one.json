The maddened braying of Shub-Niggurath is suddenly absent, and the dark young with it. Only the bodies of cultists and their ruined ritual remain to tell the tale of what transpired in these brief minutes.\nThea collapses to the forest floor from exhaustion and relief building on each other, with tears in the corners of her eyes. \"It's over... I hope to God it's over, at least. I don't know if I could stand another minute near that... that terrible thing.\" You ease yourself down next to Thea, even more tired and shaken, but no less relieved. You didn't have a Roman legion at your command, but you hope that your scattering of the cult and destruction of the ritual was every bit as effective as Apuleius' attempt two thousand years ago. With any luck, it will be another two thousand years until the cult of Shub-Niggurath can attempt anything this vile again.\nSlow minutes pass in the early afternoon sun, and the redwood forest takes on a different character entirely. If you told anyone of your harrowing battle in this isolated and now-peaceful place, anyone would reasonably think you a liar at best. You and Thea don't have to exchange any words to understand that the events of the eclipse must remain secret. At least to those who aren't prepared for the disturbing truth.
