You nearly flinch as a shadow sweeps across the moon, which leads your view to a worse spectacle.  Four massive figures tower above the camp, large enough to be oak trees -- and indeed resembling them in silhouette -- but far more horrible.  Like the smaller abominations you encountered in the woods, these things are a horrid jumble of tentacles, mouths, hooves, and horns.  They writhe and roar dully with sluggish movements.  Perhaps these monsters are rousing from sleep, which lends a little more urgency to the mission.  Thea holds a hand over her mouth in shock, but soon lowers it with a shudder.  Whether or not she's seen them in her visions before, this appears to be the first time in person.  It goes without saying that you must plan how to proceed in finding and rescuing the captives."

        "text": "Your escape from the circus camp is a slow and quiet affair, and you do not breathe easily until the woods begin to thin and the outermost buildings of Arkham are visible in the pre-dawn light.  The grateful citizens shed tears of relief, thanking you up and down for your heroic efforts in saving them.  Your appreciation is muddled by the civilians all agreeing that beyond the circus performers and their animals, it was only the night playing tricks on them.  Many of them have repressed the horrors, and are eager to leave them behind without another thought.\nWhile you suppose the safety of the citizens was priority, it will be on your shoulders once again to discover just what deeper mysteries the circus is hiding.  There is more at work than wanton murder, that much is certain.",

        "text": "After sending off the rescued victims and urging them to inform the police of last night's events, you are left with only Thea.  There is still much to discuss of her visions and the stolen tome, and you invite her to enlighten you after you've both had some sorely-needed rest.\nYou sleep deeply through the morning, assured at least a little that the circus won't attack you in broad daylight in the heart of Arkham with their horrors in tow.  Restful as it is, your dreams flash with the vivid imagery of the previous night.  The circus.  The grinning ringmaster.  The moon.  Those creatures.  The forest.  Voices.  Chanting.  Terror.  You awaken with a sudden surge of adrenaline, but find nothing but the stillness of your own bedroom.\nThea is still fitfully asleep as you step out to visit the police.  In the hours since your return, the public outcry forced a full investigation of the circus.  Frustratingly -- and predictably, perhaps -- the police found nothing but trampled mud at the circus grounds, and even the few willing officers they sent into the woods reported only an abandoned campsite.  Naturally they promised to keep on the case, but without anything immediate to chase, you expect that the New Moon Circus will be filed away in their cold case cabinets.\nOnce again the burden falls to you, but where to start?  The only trace of the circus left in town are the posters that drew the public in to begin with.  You find the nearest one that hasn't been torn down by traumatized citizens and inspect it.",
