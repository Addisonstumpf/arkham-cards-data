Given your treatment on the railways west, Blake is not content to let you live, but at the same time, has been reluctant to act within large cities. You've essentially reached a stalemate, and not one that Blake can afford to wait out. Still, with the final circus show tonight and the eclipse tomorrow, you'd be a fool not to keep a close eye on him.\nThe circus grounds lie a short distance outside the city limits, but as you approach the road leading to it, you find a total lack of activity. Surely some early spectators or curious onlookers would be gathered outside, but there is nothing at all. A pit grows in your stomach as you approach the circus grounds and find them silent. From the open gates, you survey an empty site, like the one the police found in Arkham after their departure.\nOne circus poster remains hanging beside the abandoned grounds, with the word CANCELED painted in red diagonally across it. Panic begins to flood your system. You had counted on Blake's ego to see the spectacle to the end, but has he really given you the slip? Without any leads, you'd have to comb all of southern California -- an option you can't afford to pursue with only one day remaining. You earnestly hope that some clue was left in their hurry to leave, and you step forward to investigate.\nThe instant you cross the threshold, light and sound flood your senses. Your eyes open blearily to see the entire circus before you -- and impenetrable iron bars behind you. Memories of the illusions from the circus' night in Arkham return, and the truth dawns on you. The New Moon Circus was here and fully prepared, masking their appearance to the Los Angeles public with those same illusions. Only you would have entered the abandoned grounds so soon before a canceled show, and now you're in Blake's domain once more. What's the plan now?"

The revelation also lends some clarity to Blake's fervent belief in the prophecies of old. In one form or another, he -- or it, rather -- may have been present for those events.\nThe instant you pass through the revealed entrance, the spectacle ceases and the calm ambiance of the Los Angeles afternoon greets you. You wait tensely, still ready to fight or flee, but the circus grounds lie silent. Even in this form, Blake may not want to risk revealing anything that would betray the coming ritual -- the very thing that you must discover before tomorrow.",

As the thing roils, the illusions surrounding the circus blur and dissolve, like smoke in a strong wind. The face of the goat shifts briefly to a crude visage of Blake once more before one final screech bellows out, and its form is suddenly gone.\nStripped away from the circus grounds, the vanishing illusions reveal ripped tents, cracked lights, and an air of decay lingering in the aftermath. No trace of the other performers or savage monsters remain, leaving you alone to ponder the end of the ringmaster.\nThe revelation that Sylvester Blake was an incarnation of the Black Goat is unsettling to say the least, but explains just why he -- or it, rather -- believed so fervently in prophecies and visions. As an extension of Shub-Niggurath, it has existed for millennia, likely even guided the ancient cult that Apuleius helped to destroy. The cosmic events surrounding this ritual factored into everything that Blake did with the circus. And even without Blake, the ritual will continue... but where?",

There simply wouldn't be time enough for everything. A branch of the cult of Shub-Niggurath must have been long established here in Los Angeles, preparing for the eclipse.\nYou settle into your room to ponder the problem, weighing time and risk in frustrating repetition. Not long into your meditations, Thea sits up with a quizzical expression and carries the book over to you. \"Remember how the cult in ancient Rome disguised itself as one of Bacchus? What if they're using the same tactic now, hiding in plain sight as another organization like it?\"",
