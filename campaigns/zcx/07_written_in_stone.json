You open it cautiously, but find Thea -- her own room directly across the hall from yours -- with the tome held to her chest. You usher her inside quickly and lock the door. \"I didn't really have a chance during the journey, but I have to talk with y'all about what I learned from this book.\" You sit with Thea at the small table that the hotel room provides.\n\"The book -- De Cultus Bestiae -- was written by Apuleius, who lived in the Roman Empire. He was a scholar and poet, and he dabbled in several cults. Normally that would be cults in the old sense, like specific parts of the Roman pantheon, but this account is specifically about the cult of... Shub-Niggurath.\"\nThe tome tells the details of the cult of Shub-Niggurath -- disguised as a cult of Bacchus -- and how Apuleius infiltrated it, learned their secrets, and aided the local Roman governor in dissolving the cult in that region. Most of the horrors are known to you through your recent trials, but Thea goes on to explain several key revelations.\n\"He claims that Shub-Niggurath can be summoned by a ritual in a forest during any new moon, but only temporarily. The cult back in that time was devising a ritual to permanently summon their god by locking the moon in place during an eclipse, but their works were burned when the cult was scattered. The high priest even laid out a prophecy before his execution, which Apuleius recorded in the tome.\"\nThea shows you a passage which she translates as she reads.\n\"By the cunning of the Lord of the Woods, consort of the Mother Goddess, the words will once more be known, her mighty young fattened, and the stars of the black sky be aligned. Red will be the dawn and red the forest when neither moon nor sun shine down again. IÃ¤! Shub-Niggurath! The Goat with a Thousand Young!\"\nThea swallows dryly as she completes the passage. \"I know how he felt now. That prophecy is immediately followed up by a short protective prayer to Diana, the Roman goddess of wild animals,the hunt, and the moon.\" She again shows you the book, this time saying the Latin phrase aloud."
