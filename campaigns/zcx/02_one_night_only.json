You catch an unsettling glint in his eyes as he raises his head to address the cheering citizens.\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, welcome to the greatest spectacle of your lives! Watch in amazement as I, Sylvester Blake, ringmaster of the New Moon Circus, unveil our most impossible trick!\" The ringmaster's voice booms out, but with a tone just as unnatural as his appearance. He weaves his hands through the air with a magician's deftness, and one of the elephants rears up with a trumpet call.  Cheers and applause ring out from the audience as the elephant repeats its motion, but its call grows distorted and its form begins to waver. When the animal rises for a third time, its head begins to split, and its cry is utterly alien. The crowd's cheering gives way to horrified screams, and pandemonium breaks."

Considering Minnie's report of their sudden trek north to Arkham as well, there has to be some deliberate purpose behind the chaos tonight, but what?\nThe ringmaster -- Sylvester Blake -- is sure to have the answers to everything.  A man of his stark and menacing appearance shouldn't be hard to lose track of, but he disappeared shortly after the chaos began.  Likely more of the circus illusions at work.

A twig cracks under your foot in the approach, and the abductor snaps his head up toward you for barely a second before he abandons his prey and retreats into the forest.  The boy scrabbles back against a tree, and only once you introduce yourself calmly does he visibly settle.  You tell him to get back to Arkham without delay, and he does, only giving a mumbled thank you as he runs off.\nOne down, dozens to go.  You turn your attention back to the moonlit trees.  Most people avoid the Arkham woods during the day, to say nothing of its dangers at night, but you have little choice.  The circus performers must have kidnapped dozens of people during the bedlam.  If you don't rescue the victims tonight, before the circus has a chance to leave, then they're as good as dead, and whatever foul mission the circus pursues will be that much closer to fruition.  You summon your strength and courage for the long night ahead.",
