The profane prophecy did mention a red forest, but you didn't expect such a literal result from the cryptic old text. The scope and scale of the trees is humbling, and reminds you of the colossal dark young that the circus bred. The prospect of meeting them in broad daylight isn't any more appealing whatsoever.\nThe forest is quiet as you take the trodden trail north. Even the song of birds that would normally fill the air is absent. It's said that animals go silent when predators are about, and the monstrosities the cult keeps are as terrible as predators come. They'd consume every living thing for miles if only they could. You'd be wise to proceed with caution, and yet the sun is already halfway up the sky."
