You clamber down the back steps to find Ralph waiting for you.\n\"Well... I guess this is the end of the line.  To be honest, I'm not sure if we could go any further with you if we wanted.  After that journey... I'm already going to have nightmares.\"  He looks to his daughter, and Carrie rubs one of her arms, nodding with a rueful expression.  \"But you've got that strength to see it through.  We're counting on you.  Not just for our family, but for everybody's families.  We'll see you back in Arkham, God willing.\"  Carrie gives you and Thea tense embraces in farewell, while Ralph just offers a handshake, both covering their fear as much as they can.\nYou book into a modest hotel and collapse, still weary despite having slept through the night.  You wonder how much Blake has prepared over the last week and a half, and just how much a difference your actions over the journey have made.",
