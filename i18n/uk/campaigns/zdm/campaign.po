"Some encounter cards in this campaign will have icons indicated on the bottom of the card when they are face down. These encounter cards will be used to form the \"scanning deck\", an out of play deck of cards that will be constructed during the setup of some scenarios.\n"
"In this campaign, abilities identified by the <b>Scan</b> action designator allows investigators to explore your environment. Such abilities are generally used to find story assets, story cards or locations in the scanning deck to help progress within each scenario, and are usually, but not always, initiated using the “activate” action.\n"
"<b>Scan</b> abilities instruct you to search for the top card of the scanning deck matching a certain icon. In such cases, look at the icons on the bottom of the top card in the scanning deck. <b>If the top card of the scanning deck has an icon matching the icon you are scanning for, draw that card.</b> This is considered a “successful” scan. If no cards were drawn, the scan is considered to be \"unsuccessful\".\n"
"If the topmost card does not have a matching icon, place it face down next to the scanning deck, and look for a matching icon on the next card of the scanning deck. Repeat this process until a card of the indicated type is drawn. After this action has ended, shuffle each card next to the scanning deck back into the scanning deck.\n"
"<b>Scan</b> abilities will usually, but not always, refer to the icon of a location. The icon of a location is the connection symbol that is located in the top left corner of the card.\n"
"If such a situation arises that you would need to discard a card with the scanning back or shuffle it into any other deck, shuffle it back into the scanning deck instead."

"<i>Are we allowed to <b>peak at the icons remaining</b> on cards in the scanning deck?</i>\n"
"To avoid spoilers or meta-gaming, it would be better not to peak. But there is no explicit rule that prevents you from doing so if you would like to do it. The scanning back of top card of the scanning deck is also always meant to be visible."

"Some scenario cards, story resolutions and interludes may refer to your \"Memories\". Each investigator has a section in the Campaign Log to mark their individual \"Memories\". <b>These \"Memories\" are tied to specific investigators, and are not shared among all of the investigators.</b>\n"
"You may be instructed to add tally marks or cross out tally marks to specific investigator's \"Memories\". This is done by marking a line in that investigator's \"Memories\" section in the Campaign Log, or crossing out one of the above lines, respectively. The number of \"Memories\" each investigator has is equal to the number of tally marks in their respective sections that have not been crossed out."
