"You would hesitate to call the darkened pit you find yourself in \"safe\" by any means, but you feel as though this is as good a place as any to rest. It was hard enough to tell the time with the sun always lingering in the Antarctic sky—now, deep underground with no sunlight to speak of, it is impossible. When one of your companions checks their pocketwatch and informs the team that fourteen hours have passed since you went underground, the response is one of utter disbelief. You do not remember traveling that long, but your body is weary enough to prove it.\n"
"In gloomy silence, you and the others set up camp once more. Your numbers have dwindled to only yourself and the few experts who remain from those originally introduced to you by Dr. Kensler. The rest of the students and researchers are either back at the barrier camp where you first disembarked from the Theodosia, or… no longer with you.\n"
"The cavern is easily large enough for what few of you remain, and the icy floor brittle enough to stake down your tents. Even so, it does not truly feel safe. You wonder if you will ever feel safe again."

"Сложно назвать безопасным местом тёмное подземелье, где вы оказались, и всё же оно кажется вполне пригодным для ночёвки. Если наверху, под незаходящим антарктическим солнцем определять время было сложно, то здесь, в кромешном мраке глубоко под землёй, это и вовсе невозможно. Кто-то, взглянув на карманные часы, сообщает, что с начала спуска прошло четырнадцать часов, и в ответ раздаются недоверчивые возгласы. Вы не помните, чтобы шли так долго, но ваши усталые мускулы подтверждают это.\n"
"В мрачном молчании вы разбиваете лагерь. В отряде остались только вы да несколько специалистов, с которыми ещё в Бостоне познакомила вас доктор Кенслер. Остальные студенты и учёные либо остались в базовом лагере, который вы разбили после высадки с «Феодосии», либо… покинули вас навсегда.\n"
"Пещера достаточно просторна для немногих оставшихся в команде, а ледяной пол позволяет установить палатки. Тем не менее вы всё равно не чувствуете себя в безопасности. Сможете ли вы когда-нибудь снова испытать это чувство?"

msgid "You only have enough time to check on a few team members (regardless of whether they are alive or crossed out). One at a time, choose and read three of the sections below (four instead if <i>the team was guided to the hidden tunnel</i>). If the game effect of the chosen section cannot be performed, it does not count toward this total and you may choose a new section instead."
msgstr "У вас есть немного времени, чтобы заглянуть к нескольким спутникам (не имеет значения, живы они или вычеркнуты).

Если игровой эффект выбранного раздела не может быть разыгран, он не идёт в счёт лимита и вы можете выбрать вместо него другой раздел."

msgid "The professor, who was originally reluctant to join the expedition at all, seems to have completely changed his tune… although this new side of him worries you even more. \"I understand now why Danforth wanted to return,\" he explains. \"It is calling to us. Can you not feel it? Can you not hear it? It wants us to keep going.\" You ask him what 'it' he refers to, and he gestures vaguely around the both of you. \"It. I don't know. These phantasms don't act like independent creatures, do you not think? Perhaps they are controlled by a greater force. Or…\" he considers his next words carefully. \"Perhaps they are all one and the same. Extensions of one nameless madness. I wonder—what would Danforth and I have discovered had we not fled? Perhaps we could have avoided all this suffering…\""
msgstr ""
"Профессор, который сперва противился экспедиции, кажется, в корне изменил своё мнение… И это тревожит вас даже сильнее.\n"
"— Теперь я понимаю, почему Данфорт хотел вернуться, — признаётся он. — Оно зовёт нас. Разве вы не чувствуете? Разве не слышите? Оно хочет, чтобы мы шли дальше.\n"
"Вы спрашиваете, что за «оно», и профессор широким жестом обводит окружающее вас пространство.\n"
"— Оно. Я не знаю. Эти фантомы не ведут себя как самостоятельные существа, вам так не кажется? Думаю, ими управляет нечто большее. Или… — Он осторожно подбирает слова. — Возможно, все они суть одно и то же. Проявления одного безымянного безумия. Интересно, если бы мы с Данфортом не сбежали, что бы мы нашли? Вдруг мы могли бы избежать всех этих страданий?.."

msgid "You don't speak to Danforth that night. He is the one who speaks, but to what entity, you cannot tell. At first you believe him to be mumbling to himself as he often does, but soon you realize it is a dialogue you only partially hear. \"We are close,\" he declares quietly. \"I followed, just as you showed me. Just a little further, and I will see you again. We can be together again. We can be… whole.\" Finally, you decide you have heard enough. You clasp a hand on Danforth's shoulder, startling him. You swear you see just the slightest tinge of something misty leaking from his eyes as he turns around, but then he wipes them with his sleeve, and it is gone. \"Oh, it is just you,\" he comments. \"W-well then. We should get some rest, should we not? We have a long day ahead of us.\""

"Этой ночью вы не говорите с Данфортом. Это он говорит, но с кем или с чем, вам неведомо. Поначалу вы думаете, что он, как это часто бывает, бормочет себе под нос, но вскоре понимаете, что слышите только половину диалога.\n"
"— Я близко, — тихо произносит он. — Я пришёл по указанному тобой пути. Ещё немного, и я увижу тебя снова. Мы снова будем вместе. Мы будем… едины.\n"
"Наконец вы решаете, что слышали достаточно. Вы кладёте руку Данфорту на плечо, и он резко оборачивается. Вы могли бы поклясться, что заметили призрачный туман, вытекающий из его глаз, но Данфорт сразу вытирает их рукавом, и туман исчезает.\n"
"— А, это вы, — говорит он. — Н-ну что же. Пожалуй, нам не помешает отдохнуть. Впереди долгий день."

msgid "Dr. Kensler is in an absolute panic when you enter her tent. Her gaze rises to meet yours for just a moment before she goes back to rummaging through her materials. \"It is here somewhere, I know it…\" she mumbles. You've never seen Dr. Kensler in such disarray before. \"Ah! Here.\" The book she identifies is not one of her treatises on biology or a textbook filled with anatomical diagrams. It is an old, moldy tome unrelated to any of the sciences, written in French. \"I know I saw it in here…\" she mumbles, scouring the tome's pages for a specific passage. You sit nearby in silence, almost too frightened to ask anything. Dr. Kensler has changed completely from her usual cold, stoic demeanor. \"Here!\" She marks her page and snaps back to you. \"Can I trust you?\" You nod your head. Whatever Dr. Kensler has found, you get the feeling she is only showing you because you have shared in her discoveries up until this point. She opens the tome to a depiction of some unfamiliar, cosmic hierarchy-the kind of absurd dogmatic theory that any self-respecting scientist would scoff at. \"Henry Armitage was the only other person at the university who did not approve of this undertaking. He is the one who showed me this, after Dyer submitted his report.\" She points to the section of the diagram illustrating the Earth, and you note the pattern of intersecting lines at its edge. \"The south pole,\" she says. \"At the edge of the Earth, where the lines meet. The culmination of eldritch forces, he said. Superstitious nonsense, I presumed. But my research proves otherwise. These creatures—these phantom mirages, eidolons of broken minds, they did not arrive here. They were always here. From the very beginning. Do you understand?\" She grips her miasma sample tight. \"And we… we weren't the first to stumble across them.\""

msgid "For the first time since the expedition set out, Dr. Sinha seeks you out personally, inquiring after your wounds. You show her your injuries, and she nods along, holding back her usual castigation. She tends your wounds in silence until she finally speaks. \"I have lost so many patients, I can no longer keep track,\" she reveals. \"Most of the time, there was nothing to be done. That is just the nature of things, I suppose. We are fragile creatures, after all. Bend us just a little bit, and we tend to break.\" She winds a bandage around your arm with practiced precision, but you spot the subtle shaking in her hands. \"I went into this profession because I could not stand seeing people hurt. It was a pretty foolish decision, looking back. After all, in this profession, all I do is see people hurt.\" You ask her if there is any satisfaction in seeing them healthy, once her work is done. \"Of course,\" she replies, after a long sigh. \"But this time…\" She averts her gaze from your eyes, her voice practically a whisper. \"I do not think I will get that satisfaction. Do you?\""

msgid "Cookie draws his Colt as vou approach. You can tell from his bloodshot eyes and shaking hand that he has not rested in some time. The moment he realizes it's only you, he apologizes and lowers the weapon. \"Thought you were one of—well y'know,\" he explains half-heartedly. You remark that you're lucky he has any trigger discipline left. \"Trigger discipline,\" he scoffs. A long pause hangs in the air. \"C'mon. Help me with the fire.\" In silence, you and the grizzled veteran set what remains of your firewood in the center of the camp and attempt to light it. In the cold, damp conditions, it takes almost half an hour of effort before the fire is lit. It eagerly consumes the kindling, casting dancing shadows along the icy walls of the cavern. Finally, Cookie breaks the silence. \"This,\" he utters decisively. \"I remember this.\" You don't bother to ask—you only have to meet his faraway gaze to know he is referring to the feeling of impending death permeating the camp. \"Piece of advice\" he offers, \"when the time comes, you can't hesitate. Don't matter how many of us are left. Don't matter what manner of doom yer staring down. You flinch, you die.\" You nod in understanding. You get the feeling Cookie's never flinched once in his life."

msgid "Claypool studies the icy walls as you approach, his brow furrowed with concern. \"It should be warmer here,\" he notes, \"but even without windchill, it is almost 10 degrees colder.\" Just then, something moves inside the ice—a shadow, perhaps, or something reflecting off its surface. You and Claypool instinctively back away as the fleeting darkness swirls and vanishes. No light behind you could have cast that shadow. \"There is… something wrong with this ice,\" Claypool whispers. \"This cold, it is unnatural. Dyer's report described these inner structures as warm and habitable, but this is…\" You share a knowing glance. \"We need to be prepared. For anything.\""

msgid "You already know what Ellsworth is thinking when he approaches you, a lantern in one of his hands and an icepick in the other. \"You up for a little trip?\" He hands the lantern to you, and together you break off from the camp. You make quiet, cautious conversation as you explore the icy depths, covering far more ground between the two of you than you could with the rest of your team and what is left of your supplies. \"You must think me some manner of mad or foolish,\" he guesses after an hour of fast-paced travel. \"Always going off alone, getting into danger like this. Into places we should not end up.\" You shrug and point out the fact that you, too, are here with him. \"Right. So I doubt your opinion of me is unbiased,\" he jokes. A blast of chill, putrid air wafts through the cave like the exhale of a monstrous beast, with you down its throat. \"Well, for what it is worth, I sure am glad to have you here,\" the explorer admits, a quiver of hesitation in his voice. \"Look—\" he points ahead at a fork in the tunnel. The foul gust dies down around you, but it clearly came from the left-hand path. \"Something that way is circulating air. That has to mean something, right?\" You nod in agreement, but you sure as hell don't like the smell of it…"

msgid "You come to Takada not for help, but with an accusation. She has been preparing in secret—you can tell from the provisions she keeps from the rest of the party, the aeroplane parts she tinkers with in her spare time. \"You are right.\" She sighs in response to your allegation. \"I was thinking of going back. Breaking off in secret, heading back to the ice shelf, and getting as far away from this damned place as possible. But…\" she glances at the rest of the team, their mood hopeful despite the ominous feeling in the air. \"I would never make it back on my own. Do not worry. I am not going anywhere. Go ahead, take whatever is in that pack for yourself.\" You choose to trust her, though you cannot help but worry. Her usual monotone is full of jaded cynicism, but this is different. She sounds as though she has given up. \"Why are you still here?\" she asks after a long while. \"You have what you came for.\" You shake your head and tell her that you are here for her. She chances the hint of a smile. \"Well that is awful foolish of you. But… thanks.\""

msgid "It isn't difficult to find Eliyah. Anyu's insistent barking makes his location all too obvious. \"Stop it, girl!\" he orders, struggling to keep her calm. The dog stands at the edge of the camp, barking at the darkness beyond as though there is something lurking at the edge of your sight. Perhaps there is. Something only she can see. \"Seriously, Anyu! Stop! You're making too much noise!\" Eliyah shouts. When he sees you approach, he motions for you to help pull her away. \"Can you grab her collar? We need to get her back to the tents.\" After some struggling, you finally manage to wrench the dog away and lead her back to camp. She whines the entire way, her snout twinging. \"She's got the scent of something,\" Eliyah says once she is calm. \"Never seen her act this way before. Whatever is up ahead, it cannot possibly be good. Or normal.\" He runs his hand through his hair and shrugs. \"But what else is new in this damned place?\""
