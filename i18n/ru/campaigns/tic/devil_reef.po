"The rumbling of the boat's engine startles you from your thoughts. \"Yeh all right there?\" the ship's captain growls. \"Yeh look like ye've seena ghost. Pale as a sheet, yeh are.\"\n"
"You turn and face the grizzled old man. Mr. Moore was the only ship captain you could find in Innsmouth who was unafflicted by whatever curse or deformity has gripped most of the town. His apparent hunanity, however, has done nothing to spare his broken teeth, crooked jaw, or the massive scar torn down his right cheek. Still, he is a welcome sight, considering the way the rest of your investigation has gone.\n"
"\"Can't believe you want to head to that accurs'd Devil Reef,\" he exclaims, shaking his head. \"It's a fool's errand.\"\n"
"You point out that the sailor was happy enough to provide passage after you showed him his payment, earning a raspy chuckle out of him.\n"
"\"Yeh got me there,\" he admits. \"Now get ready. We set off in ten.\" He stumbles from the main deck into the bridge to chart a course while you prepare for the journey ahead."

"Agent Dawson boards the ship at last. He sports a heavy overcoat and carries a shotgun slugged over his shoulder. \"Agent Harper had a cache with some extra firepower,\" he explains. \"I figured, given the rumors, it couldn't hurt.\"\n"
"You know what rumors Dawson refers to: Devil Reef is supposedly haunted, or perhaps infested, with some manner of devilish sea creature. The sailors of Innsmouth speak of silhouettes crawling in and out of caves along the reef's many islands, of strangely misshapen fins sighted along the surface of the sea, and of entire boats crashing against the jagged rocks and vanishing beneath the waves.\n"
"\"All of our research has led to this. Whatever is going on in this town, the Esoteric Order of Dagon and this 'Devil Reef' are at the heard of it. Agent Harper suspects these rumors were spread by the Order to keep sailors away from the reef. If that's true, there must be something the Order is hiding.\"\n"
"You ask where Harper is, and Dawson shoots you a hard glance. \"She has her mission. We have ours.\" You remind Dawson that you've already accomplished the mission you were hired to perform, which yields a smirk from the hardened vet. \"True. And yet here you are.\"\n"
"He has a point. You could have left right after Harper was rescued, but you stayed to assist with their investigation. Perhaps out of a sense of duty, or perhaps curiosity. Whatever it was, you're here now, and there's no going back."

"Agent Dawson boards the ship at last. Heavy bags uner his weary eye. \"All of our leads are cold,\" he says with resignation. \"Wherever Agent Harper is now, she's beyond our reach.\"\n"
"You attempt to console Dawson by reminding him why you've chosen to investigate Devil Reef. The rumors say it is haunted, or perhaps infested, with some manner of devilish sea creature. The sailors of Innsmouth speak of silhouettes crawling in and out of caves along the reef's many islands, of strangely misshapen fins sighted along the surface of the sea, and of entire boats crashing against the jagged rocks and vanishing beneath the waves.\n"
"\"You're right,\" Dawson admits with a sigh. \"Whatever happened to Agent Harper has something to do with the Esoteric Order of Dagon. That book that was slipped under your hotel room door is evidence enough of that. And if my hypothesis is right, the ones who have been spreading these rumors about Devil Reef are none other than the Order themselves. If that's true, there must be something they're hiding.\"\n"
"You nod and begin preparing for the mission. Agent Dawson gazes at you inquisitively the entire time. \"Why did you stay?\" he finally asks. \"You could have left Innsmouth after we failed to rescue Agent Harper, but you chose to stick around. Why?\"\n"
"Truth be told, you aren't sure. Perhaps it was a sense of duty. Perhaps it was curiosity. You shrug and tell him it doesn't matter. You're here now, and there's no going back. Your admission earns you a smile from the hardened vet.\n"
"\"Right. Let's go find what they're hiding,\" he says."

"As you wade through the flooded cavern, your foot strikes something hard and metallic. The water is too dark and murky for you to see what lies beneath the surface. Holding your breath, you dive into the water and grope around for the object. Eventually, your hands wrap around something smooth and heavy. You drag it up to the surface and heave it onto an outcropping of rock.\n"
"It is a statue depicting some kind of entity—or perhaps a deity—although it is unlike any religious figure you have ever seen.

"You swim through an array of vast undersea halls until at least you come to a circle of pillars. Inside this submerged henge stands an altar covered in an ornate cloth. It is embroidered with rich threads of gold and inlaid with cerulean opals. Despite being immersed in water, the fabric appears perfectly preserved. Wondering what such an object is doing deep in this underwater cavern, you decide to take it with you.\n"
"The moment you emerge from the depths and onto dry stone, you realize with amazement that the cloth is perfectly dry. Turning it over in your hands, you find a clasp of gold and realize it is not simply shapeless cloth, but a mantle—perhaps even part of a greater outfit. When you don the strange cloak, its gemstones pulse with arcane power."

"Truth be told, you're not completely sure. What you found was startling. The coves and tidal caverns of Devil Reef were home not just to relics of the Esoteric Order of Dagon, but also to a horde of strange creatures: hybrids between fish, man, and monster. You might have escaped with your life, but the horrors you saw in those caves will stay with you forever. Sharp jagged teeth—blood-stained altars—unholy prayers—signs of a coming catastrophe—it still haunts you even after your escape.\n"

"Harper rolls her eyes and turns too you. \"I can't believe I was abducted by this goof. Certainly a low point in my career.\" You offer that it was precisely his bumbling nature that allowed the boy to catch her off guard. \"I suppose you're right. Anyhow, what's done is done. What do you make of all this?\" she asks, crossing her arms. \"The boy seems to think it was wiser to ambush a federal agent than run afoull of this 'Order.' Think he's telling the truth?\"\n"
"You might have miscalculated Mr. Burnham's capabilities, but he certainly seems to be more afraid of this Order than he is of you. With a sigh, you nod.\n"

"\"You don't understand,\" Othera replies. \"Come. Look. You'll see.\" She motions to the door next to her, which you haven't yet searched. Inside is a stash of oil paintings, dozens and dozens of them, all depicting the same thing: a tumultuous maelstrom in the middle of the ocean, over which the sun and the moon hang in perfect alignment against a red-tinged sky. \"What in the hell...?\" Agent Harper wonders aloud as she sorts through the many reproductions.\n"

So I did what had to be done.\"\n"
"\"I don't understand. Too close to what, exactly, Ms. Little?\" Harper asks.\n"
"\"There is a secret at the heart of this town. A secret that brings us wealth. A secret that brings us power. A secret that brings us...\" She pauses to find the right words. \"...closer to our destiny.\"\n"
"\"And what kind of secret is that?\" Harper probes.\n"
"Joyce smirks and shakes her head. \"What makes you think I would ever share that with outsiders?\"\n"
"\"Because you assaulted a federal agent, and if you don't tell me what I want to know, your 'destiny' is going to be the inside of a lonely prison cell.\"\n"

"You are taken aback by the severity of the old man's threat and his simmering hatred, but Harper simply chortles. \"You call this place 'fair'?\" Ignoring her derision, you warn Barnabas that if he doesn't speak up, he'll be spending a long time behind bars.\n"
"\"Not I,\" he remarks. \"You're the one who'll be locked up, 'n worse. When the Order's done with you, you'll be nothin' but fish food.\"\n"

"Zadok rocks back and forth, his voice growing louder and bolder. \"My game? My game?\" he roils with manic laughter. \"Yeh think I'm to blame, but them fish devils are in our midst, they are!

"After handing Robert the cigar he demanded, you are surprised to find him a little more compliant, though no more friendly despite his name. \"Doesn't matter,\" he mutters, blowing out a puff of rank cigar smoke. \"You're all dead men walking. No offense, miss.\"\n"
"\"Offense taken,\" she bites back. \"Care to tell us what you mean by that?\"\n"
"\"The Order,\" he replies with a quiet, unwavering resolve. \"They know everything that happens in this town. Probably out lookin' for me right now. You sure you wanna be here when they find me?\" He flashes a sadistic grin.\n"
