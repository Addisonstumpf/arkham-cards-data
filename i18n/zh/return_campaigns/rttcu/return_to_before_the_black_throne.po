"This is it. The end of all things, and the nighted throne of the being known as Azathoth. You know there is no sense in harming it—if such a thing can even suffer harm—so you set about finding another way to prevent it from waking. You understand now that the spirits you saw in Hangman's Hill were trying to warn you. Trying to drive you away from the same path Keziah led them down so many years ago. Anette's incantation served as this creature's alarm, and so you shall transform it into a lullaby.\n"
"It takes ages for you to find within these vast timeless halls the spirit that knows how to reverse the incantation. And it takes even longer to drag the words from its hollow throat. But together, you speak aloud the rite that ends Keziah's work once and for all. Azathoth slumbers once more, though you know it will not last forever. With your task complete, you turn and face the darkness, summoning your steed. It is time to go home."

"終於到了。萬物歸一，還有名為阿撒托斯的存在的漆黑王座。你知道傷害它毫無意義——如果這樣的東西也能被傷害——於是你開始尋找另一種方法來防止它醒來。你現在明白了，你在絞刑者山丘看到的鬼魂是在試圖警告你，試圖讓你不要重蹈多年前凱夏帶它們經歷的覆轍。安妮特的咒語是這個怪物的鬧鐘，而你要把它轉變成一首催眠曲。\n"
"你在這些巨大而永恆的大廳中花了很長時間，才找到了知曉如何反轉咒語的靈魂。而讓它空洞的喉嚨發聲則花了更長時間。但你們還是共同大聲念出了儀式，永遠終結了凱夏的咒語。阿撒托斯又一次陷入沉眠，但你知道它不會永遠地睡下去。任務完成後，你轉身面對黑暗，召喚你的坐騎。是時候回家了。"
