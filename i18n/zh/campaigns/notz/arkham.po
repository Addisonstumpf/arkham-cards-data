msgid "The woman came to you in a panic, raving about monsters emerging from the ground in a home near Rivertown. “I managed to trap them,” she explains, “but there are others. Other pits. Other domains.” Only last week, you would have thought she was a lunatic. Recent events, however, have challenged your preconceptions of normality. You decide to hear her out. She introduces herself as Lita Chantler and lays out a tale that strains the limits of your belief. “The creatures I speak of ,” she claims, “are called ghouls—cruel beings who plague the crypts, caverns, and tunnels beneath the city of Arkham…”"

"突然有一個女人慌慌忙忙地向你們跑來，說什麼在河岸城旁邊的一座房子裡，有一堆怪物不停地從地底下湧出。“我想要把它們都困住，”她解釋道，“但是數量太多了。而且它們不只有這一個出口。”如果上週遇到她，你可能覺得她是瘋子。但是現在看來，這可能與近期的事件有所關聯，儘管這一切都難以想像。你決定讓她把話說完。\n"
"原來她名叫麗塔·錢德勒，她說了一些超越你想像的事實。“我提到的這些生物，”她說，“叫做食屍鬼，它們就在阿卡姆市地下的墓穴、洞窟以及隧道之中作亂……”"

msgstr "你家中的災難總算是結束了。麗塔·錢德勒，那個在你客廳中的紅髮女子，敘述了一些真相。就算你在家中看到了那副光景，你也難以想像她說的都是真實的。“你家裡的那些生物，”她說，“叫做食屍鬼，它們就在阿卡姆市地下的墓穴、洞窟以及隧道之中作亂……”"

"“These creatures feed on the corpses of humans, and they are served by a dark cult within Arkham whose members have inexplicably come to worship the ancient master of the ghouls. This cult has been killing innocent people and feeding them to the ghouls, satiating a monstrous hunger. A dark balance was maintained. Until now. Recently,” Lita continues, “one of their lairs, where the corpses were stored, was destroyed. Since then, the ghouls have been more active than usual. I have tracked their movements and tried my best to stop them from running amok throughout the city. But I think there is something worse going on. The cult has been planning something darker, and more ominous, than anything I have yet observed. Indications are that this plan shall come to fruition tonight, shortly after midnight. Beyond that, I cannot fathom what to expect.\n"
"“Many of the cultists,” Lita continues, “will seem like everyday people, despite their foul intentions. Whenever the cult meets, its members don masks shaped like the skulls of various animals to protect their identities from one another. These masks are our mark. Symbols of death and decay. We must unmask the cultists to expose and derail their plans. We have but a few hours. The more cultists we find before midnight, the better.”"

"“這些生物以吃人的屍體維生。在阿卡姆，有一個黑暗邪教組織，一直供奉著這些生物，他們崇信食屍鬼的遠古之主。最近，教徒們殺了不少無辜的人，用來填滿食屍鬼的無窮饑渴。以前，這些傢伙只在暗處行動，避免被人發現。但是這段期間，”麗塔頓了頓，“一個用來囤放屍體的巢穴，被人破壞了。從那時起，食屍鬼就開始頻繁地在地面活動。我跟蹤過它們，也試著去阻止它們在市裡到處亂跑。不過我想這件事不會這麼單純。教會的追求沒有這麼簡單，他們想要的力量超過我的預料。今晚，他們就要完成計畫了，時間就在午夜之後。不過具體會發生甚麼，我也無法想像。”\n"
"“很多異教徒，”麗塔繼續說道，“就隱藏在一般的民眾之中，難以分辨。當教會召見時，他們就會戴上用動物頭骨製成的面具，來隱藏其真實身分。這些面具象徵著死亡和腐朽。我們必須揭開他們的假面，找出他們的計劃。剩下的時間不太多了，午夜之前能找到的異教徒越多越好。”"
