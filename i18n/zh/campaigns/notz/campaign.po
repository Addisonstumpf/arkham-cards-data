"Friday, September 18, 1925. Arkham, Massachusetts. It is the end of a long and abnormally hot summer. The first hints of autumn beckon, but a heavy heat persists, relentless. A silent, unspoken anger grips the town. Tempers are short, and in the last week alone there have been numerous reports of townspeople coming to heated, violent blows with one another over simple misunderstandings.\n"
"And now, a call from James Hankerson. He claims to have found a dismembered body in his barn.\n"
"Blaming the weather would be too easy. There is something wrong with this town, and not a whole lot this old soothsayer can do to stop the slide. My auguries indicate a small group of investigators will soon take note of these strange happenings and set forth to make things right. I’ll be watching their progress… but I won’t be holding my breath."

"1925年9月18日，星期五，馬薩諸塞州，阿卡姆市。漫長而又炎熱的夏天，終於到了盡頭。秋天還剛來沒多久，酷熱仍未退去。城裡壟罩著一種寂靜、無法言說的憤懣氛圍。人們的脾氣變得暴躁，僅在上週就有多不可計的報導指出，市民們對於小小誤會反應激烈，動輒暴力相向。\n"
"現在，你接到了詹姆士·漢克森的來電。他說在穀倉裡找到了一具被肢解的屍體。\n"
"你可以把責任都推卸給這鬼天氣。不過市裡的這種情況很不尋常，快要進入一種連求神問佛都不管用的程度。你決定相信自己的直覺，並快速招募了一隻調查小隊決定找到這一系列怪事的發生原因，將一切扭回正軌。我會一直盯著你們的進度……但我可不會坐以待斃。"
