msgid "You and your partners have been investigating strange events taking place in your home city of Arkham, Massachusetts. Over the past few weeks, several townspeople have mysteriously gone missing. Recently, their corpses turned up in the woods, savaged and half-eaten. The police and newspapers have stated that wild animals are responsible, but you believe there is something else going on. You are gathered together at the lead investigator’s home to discuss these bizarre events."
msgstr "你和你的搭檔們在故鄉——馬薩諸塞州的阿卡姆市，調查著一系列的奇怪事件。在過去幾周內，發生了多起市民神秘失蹤案。最近，有人在樹林裡發現了失蹤者的屍體，屍體遭到甚麼東西的啃咬，大半都被吃掉了。警察和報紙都聲稱是野獸惹的禍，不過你可不吃這套，背後肯定有甚麼其他的原因。你們決定一同到隊長家中，討論這些怪異的事件。"

Refer to page 13 of the Rules Reference for the full rules on killed investigators.)"

msgid "You barely manage to escape your house with your lives. The woman from your parlor follows you out the front door, slamming it behind her. “You fools! See what you have done?” She pushes a chair in front of the door, lodging it beneath the doorknob. “We must get out of here. Come with me, and I will tell you what I know. We are the only ones who can stop the threat that lurks beneath from being unleashed throughout the city.” You’re in no state to argue. Nodding, you follow the woman as she runs from your front porch out into the rainy street, toward Rivertown."
msgstr "你們勉強保住性命逃出了這個房屋。客廳裡的女人跟著你們走出了大門，然後把門重重關上。“你們這群白癡！看看你們幹的好事！”她隨手拿起一把椅子，抵在門把底下。“我們必須趕緊離開。跟我來，我會把我知道的一切告訴你們。那個潛伏在地底的威脅馬上要蔓延到整個城市了，除了我們之外沒人能夠阻止它。”你們無暇多做爭論，紛紛點頭。跟著那個女人快速步入雨中的街道，向著河岸城走去。"

msgid "You nod and allow the red-haired woman to set the walls and floor of your house ablaze. The fire spreads quickly, and you run out the front door to avoid being caught in the inferno. From the sidewalk, you watch as everything you own is consumed by the flames. “Come with me,” the woman says. “You must be told of the threat that lurks below. Alone, we are surely doomed…but together, we can stop it.”"
msgstr "你點了點頭，那個紅髮女人將手中的火炬丟在地上。霎時間，你的面前變成一片火海。為了不被火焰吞噬，你用盡全力跑出前門。你站在人行道上看著你所有的東西被火焰吞沒。“跟我來吧，”那女人嘆了一口氣。“我想你們已經看到了地底的威脅之物。現在，是時候團結起來，去阻止這一切了。”"

msgid "You refuse to follow the overzealous woman’s order and kick her out of your home for fear that she will set it ablaze without your permission. “Fools! You are making a grave mistake!” she warns. “You do not understand the threat that lurks below… the grave danger we are all in!” Still shaken by the night’s events, you decide to hear the woman out. Perhaps she can shed some light on these bizarre events…but she doesn’t seem to trust you very much."
msgstr "你拒不服從那個瘋女人的指示，並且把她趕出了你的家，生怕她再把甚麼東西給燒了。“你們這群白癡！現在犯下的錯誤，以後就沒有機會補償了！”她試圖警告你們。“你們根本不懂地底下的那個東西有多可怕……我們正面臨著莫大的危險！”你們想到了剛才的事情，也許那個人說的是對的，她可能知道些你們不了解的內幕……不過她好像不太相信你們。"

msgid "You run to the hallway to try to find a way to escape the house, but the burning-hot barrier still blocks your path. Trapped, the horde of feral creatures that have invaded your home close in, and you have nowhere to run."
msgstr "你們跑到走廊，試圖找到逃離這兒的方法，但是那個巨大而又滾燙的屏障依然擋著你們。你們現在已經被這些兇殘的入侵者所包圍，無處可逃。"
