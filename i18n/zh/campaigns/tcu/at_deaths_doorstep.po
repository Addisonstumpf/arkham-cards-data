"Residents of French Hill are still in a tizzy after the sudden disappearance of several guests and house staff from the home of Mr. Josef Meiger during the night of the annual Silver Twilight charity gala last Sunday. “We are absolutely baffled as to how this could have happened,” said Mr. Meiger the day after the disappearances. “That said, we are confident that Sheriff Engle and the Arkham Police will do their due diligence in finding the missing persons.”\n"
"There is still no evidence whatsoever as to the whereabouts of Miss Gavriella Mizrah, Mr. Jerome Davids, Mr. Valentino Rivas, and Mrs. Penny White, all of whom vanished halfway through the event and have not been seen since. The police are offering a substantial reward for any person or persons who come forward with information related to these disappearances. When asked whether the police were considering the case a homicide, Sheriff Engle had this to say: “There’s no reason to suspect foul play is involved just yet. However, given the circumstances, we have to consider every possibility.” No other attendees have come forward with statements concerning the gala, which seemed to finish without a hitch despite the disappearances.\n"
"So far, none of the prominent members of the Silver Twilight Lodge have expressed any concern about the Lodge’s upcoming benefit dinner, which was recently moved to the same location: Josef Meiger’s estate in French Hill. “I am certain that this event will be a smashing success,” Mr. Meiger told the Arkham Advertiser in an interview yesterday. “There is no reason for the fair residents of Arkham to worry.”\n"

"上週日的銀暮秘社週年慈善夜活動期間，數名賓客及約瑟夫·梅吉爾先生家的工作人員突然消失，法蘭西山的居民們至今仍人心惶惶。“我們完全搞不懂這事情怎麼可能會發生。”梅吉爾先生在失蹤事件發生的第二天說道，“即便如此，我們仍然對恩格爾警長和阿卡姆警局抱有信心，相信他們會盡最大努力尋找失蹤人口。”\n"
"目前仍然沒有任何與加弗瑞拉·米兹拉克女士、傑羅姆·戴維斯先生、瓦倫蒂諾·里瓦斯先生和佩妮·懷特夫人有關的證據，他們在宴會進行到一半時消失，再也沒有出現。如有任何人士提供上述失蹤事件的有關信息，警方將予以豐厚酬勞。當問及警方是否將這宗案件視為兇殺案時，恩格爾警長說道：“現在還沒有理由懷疑這是一宗謀殺案。但是，根據目前情況，我們必須考慮到每種可能性。”沒有其他與會者就慈善宴會作出聲明，儘管有人失蹤，宴會依然圓滿結束。至今為止，銀暮秘社的傑出成員無一人對秘社即將在同一地點舉行的慈善晚宴表示擔心：位於法蘭西山的約瑟夫·梅吉爾莊園。\"我相信這次活動一定會取得圆滿成功。\"梅吉爾先生在昨天的採訪中對阿卡姆報社記者如是說，\"各位阿卡姆市民無須擔心。”\n"

"You fold up the newspaper and shove it aside on your desk, examining the other files you’ve collected over the last few days concerning the missing persons. It has been several days since your experience in the woods. You have tried to put it all out of mind, but it is impossible. Every night, you dream of a nameless place in the void of space, a faint discordant melody of hypnotizing flutes pulling you forward. Now there are others disappearing from the town without a trace. The disappearances dance along the edges of your thoughts. <i>No reason to worry</i>, you ponder, turning the man’s words over in your head. You think of the card reader and her warning, and you wonder if you are simply imagining devils where there are none. Regardless, there is only one way to know for sure. You pick up the invitation, examining the silver-embossed stationary and perfect calligraphy.\n"

msgid "The entry hall to the manor is beautifully decorated, but you find it odd that the grand staircase’s wooden balustrade has been recently repaired and, by the looks of it, hastily so. While nobody is looking, you follow the handrail up and down the stairs until you spot what you are looking for: several splinters of wood, perhaps dislodged by a bullet. You ascend the staircase once more and position yourself where one would need to be standing in order to fire such a shot. After a moment of observation, a faint glimmer near one of the decorative ferns on the second floor catches your eye. There, you find proof: a bullet casing from a .45 handgun. A gun was indeed fired in the entry hall of the manor—but if that is true, how did nobody hear the shots?"

msgid "Josef Meiger’s personal office is pretty tidy for somebody whose personal secretary just went missing. Perhaps he’s just a fastidious person…or perhaps he’s been scrubbing evidence of some wrongdoing. You find nothing of note in any of Josef’s files, but after some perusing, you realize there is one place you haven’t checked: the trash. Rooting through the garbage bin yields fruit. Near the bottom is a small pocket journal belonging to Jerome Davids, probably tossed there carelessly by the cleaning staff. You turn to the last page. There, Jerome had recorded a list of names, perhaps transcribed from Josef ’s records. You don’t know what it means yet, but it must be important."
msgstr "約瑟夫·梅吉爾的個人辦公室相當整潔，但他的秘書刚刚才失蹤。或許他只是個一絲不苟的人……又或許他是在掩蓋罪證。你在約瑟夫的檔案裡找不到任何值得注意的地方，但仔细研讀過後，你發現你少找了一處地方：垃圾桶。垃圾桶總能翻到寶的。垃圾桶深處有一本小小的随身日記，它的主人是傑羅姆·戴維斯，大概是被清潔工不小心扔到這裡來的。你翻到了最後一頁。傑羅姆在這貢上記錄了一排名字，或許是從約瑟夫的文件裡抄錄的。你暫時還不知道這些名字有什麼意義，但這一定很重要。"

msgid "The balcony outside Josef Meiger’s bedroom overlooks the rainy streets and somber spires of French Hill. According to eyewitnesses, Penny was last seen entering Josef ’s bedroom, presumably to tidy it up, or perhaps to look for one of his personal belongings. The cigarette butt on the floor of the balcony tells a different story. Penny came here for a break, and judging from how busy the rest of the staff is, it was probably a much-needed one. If she had been in any danger, could she have climbed or jumped down from the balcony? You peer over the edge. It’s possible, but unlikely. A fall from here could break a leg, or worse. She likely would have retreated back into the manor, where she could have called for help…only, nobody saw her exit from the bedroom. Something doesn’t add up. You tuck the cigarette butt into your coat pocket, hoping it’s actually a lead and not a wild goose chase."
msgstr "站在約瑟夫·梅吉丽卧室外的露臺，能將下著雨的街道與法蘭西山那昏暗的尖顶盡收眼底。據目擊者所說，他最後一次看見佩妮時，她走進了約瑟夫的卧室，猜想她是去打掃整理，或者是去找約瑟夫的個人物品。露臺地面的菸屁股表明，情况並非如此。佩妮是到道兒透透氣的，從其他工作人员的忙碌不難看出，今晚可能真的需要休息。要是她遇到了危險，她會不會從露臺往上爬，或往下跳呢？你探頭往外看。確實有這樣的可能性，但是不大。從這兒掉下去至少會断條腿。她更可能原路返回……本來她能回到莊圃求救，但是，沒有一人看到她從那間臥室裡出来。這有點說不通。你将菸屁股放入大衣口袋，期望這會是一條線索，別讓你撲個空。"

This makes the story that he “vanished when they weren’t looking” all the more unbelievable. In the billiards room, where Valentino was last seen, you corner Adam Gensler, the man he was playing billiards with just before his disappearance. “Look, I already told the cops and the reporters what I saw,” he explains, fidgeting and tapping his toes repeatedly. “Tino and I were playing billiards, I looked away, next thing I know he’s gone,” he insists angrily, returning to his billiards game. “Now where is that damned one ball?” he mutters. It might be nothing, but it looks like Valentino wasn’t the only thing to go missing that night."

"You are startled from your reverie by the sensation of something crawling up your chest, an icy hand that clasps around your throat. It grips until your breath is trapped and your windpipe starts to crack. Only there is nothing there—just a chilly draft entering the room through the open window. The wind shrill, whistling wind rattles your window frame, penetrating the safety of your home. It almost sounds like the dissonant notes of a dreadful flute: a mindless, haunting music that fills you with inexplicable terror. You rush to the window and slam it shut, hands trembling. Still, the thin, discordant notes echo around you. <i>This can’t be real</i>, you think. <i>Not here, not now</i>. But denial provides no asylum.\n"
"The cold creeps its way up your back once again. A thin, grey mist pours into the room, seeping beneath your front door and through the cracks around your window. It crawls along the ground and coils slowly around your ankles, sending shivers up your body. You run into your bedroom, slam the door, and lock it. A few seconds of respite are all you receive before the invader resumes its assault. Over and over, a heavy force slams against the door, shaking the entire room. You press against the door, trying to hold it shut. With each pounding crash, dark mist seeps through cracks appearing in the wood. With a final crash, the door shatters. You are hurled back, landing not on the floor but in a cloud of mist, gripped by a hundred spectral arms that cling into your flesh and tear you limb from limb.\n"
"NO!—That can’t be right. You are here, reading this very text. A wave of relief washes over you as you realize it is all in your head. Even so, the words compel your mind to torment you with visions of a macabre death. You find yourself glancing at your window, searching for dark mist that is not there. What if the text is trying to tell you something? Maybe—no, that’s impossible.\n"

Before any threats can be fulfilled, the silence is broken by an icy voice. “Now gentlemen, there is no need for that.” The men withdraw to reveal an elderly man you recognize as Carl Sanford, the president of the Silver Twilight Lodge. Despite the dangerous situation, his expression is almost too casual. The complete lack of fear in his posture and his actions suggests a confidence backed by substantial power. His bodyguards take several steps back, allowing you to speak with Mr. Sanford in private."

Something about that event felt peculiar to you, though you aren’t sure why. Although the guests seemed oblivious, you noticed that the staff was sweaty and jittery, and the Lodge members seemed tense as well. More than once, you noticed their gaze drawn to you, watching your every move. If you didn’t know any better, you’d think the Silver Twilight Lodge was having you tailed for some reason. Regardless, you weren’t able to find much information about the four disappearances, and you doubt you ever will. Perhaps it was nothing, after all."

The creature reconstitutes before you, and its charred hand grips your throat, holding you aloft with tremendous strength. You kick and dig your nails into the creature’s hand, struggling with the ferocity of a cornered animal, but it is no use.
