msgstr "冒險V：崇高利益"

msgid "Ever since your brush with death at Hangman’s Hill, the situation in Arkham has only worsened. In the days since, there have been more reports of “ghost sightings” and even several more disappearances. A thin layer of grey mist lingers over the streets at all hours, day and night. As soon as the sun begins to set each evening, doors are shut and locked. Without truly realizing why, very few people dare venture out at night. Some businesses have even closed their doors to customers during the day, citing “poor weather.” Things are getting out of hand."
msgstr "自打你在絞刑者山丘與死神擦肩而過，阿卡姆城的情況進一步惡化。在那之後的幾天裡，出現了更多有關“遇鬼”的報導，失蹤事件也頻頻發生。阿卡姆的街道上時刻籠罩著一層薄薄的灰霧，不分畫夜。太陽一落山，家家戶戶便關門上鎖。儘管沒什麼人明白真正的原因，但大家還是不敢在夜晚出門。一些商店甚至以“天氣惡劣”為由，在白天也關上大門不做生意。事態逐漸失控。"

msgid "The creature that appeared at the Lodge’s charity gala is clearly not bound to Josef Meiger’s manor, which means the horrors you’ve experienced could be just the start of something much worse. It is time to report your findings to the Silver Twilight Lodge. Perhaps they can help interpret the knowledge you’ve gathered, and inform you as to what your next step should be. With their help, you may be able to save Arkham…"
msgstr "秘社慈善晚宴上出現的那頭怪物顯然與約瑟夫·梅吉爾的莊園無關，這意味著更可怕的還在後頭。是時候將你的發現匯報給銀暮秘社了。或許他們能夠解讀你蒐集到的知識，告訴你下一步該做什麼。有了他們的援助，你也許就能拯救阿卡姆了……"

msgid "…though you suspect the Lodge has other interests. The Lodge clearly knows more about what is happening than they care to admit. There is a sinister purpose that lurks beneath the surface of the Lodge, and you intend to discover what that purpose is."
msgstr "……但你推測秘社另有意圖。顯然秘社對於此事的真相還有所保留，不願如實吐露。你打算找出秘社所隱瞞的歹毒目的究竟是什麼。"

msgid "The creature that appeared at the Lodge’s charity gala is clearly not bound to Josef Meiger’s manor, which means the horrors you’ve experienced could be just the start of something much worse. You’re not sure why just yet, but you know the Silver Twilight Lodge is connected to the creature in some way. Perhaps it’s time to pay the Lodge a visit—with or without their permission."
msgstr "秘社慈善晚宴上出現的那頭怪物顯然與約瑟夫·梅吉爾的莊園無關，這意味著更可怕的還在後頭。雖然現在還不知道為什麼，但你明白銀暮秘社與那頭怪物有著某種聯繫。或許是時候該探訪秘社了——不管他們批准與否。"

msgid "You can’t help but wonder if you missed something important in the home of Josef Meiger. The four disappearances that occurred at the Lodge’s charity gala could not have been a coincidence. If those victims encountered a creature like the one you saw at the graveyard, the horrors you’ve experienced could be just the start of something much worse. You’re not sure why just yet, but you are sure that the Silver Twilight Lodge is connected to these events in some way. Perhaps it’s time to pay the Lodge a visit—with or without their permission."
msgstr "你不禁回想，是不是自己在約瑟夫·梅吉爾的莊園裡錯過了什麼重要信息。秘社慈善晚宴上發生的四起失蹤事件絕非巧合。如果幾位受害者遭遇的正是你在墓地看到的怪物，那這意味著更可怕的還在後頭。雖然現在還不知道為什麼，但你確信銀暮秘社與這幾起事件有著某種聯繫。或許是時候該探訪秘社了——不管他們批准與否。"

msgid "Too many disappearances have occurred at Josef Meiger’s estate for it to be a coincidence: first, the four victims at the charity gala, then the ones who attended the benefit dinner one week later. If they encountered a creature like the one you saw at the graveyard, the horrors you’ve experienced could be just the start of something much worse. You’re not sure why just yet, but you are sure that the Silver Twilight Lodge is connected to these events in some way. Perhaps it’s time to pay the Lodge a visit—with or without their permission."
msgstr "在約瑟夫·梅吉爾莊園裡發生的失蹤事件之多，已經無法用巧合來形容：首先是慈善募捐晚會遇害的四人，然後是一周後參加慈善晚宴的賓客。如果他們遭遇的怪物正如你在墓地看到的一樣，那這意味著更可怕的還在後頭。雖然現在還不知道為什麼，但你確信銀暮秘社與這幾起事件有著某種聯繫。或許是時候該探訪秘社了——不管他們批准與否。"

"You manage to escape the building and flee on foot. As you run, you can hear a thunderous rumble coming from the manor. Several others burst through the front door behind you, too preoccupied to notice you. One yells to her companions: “Get out and gather at the Unvisited Isle! We have to perform the binding rite with or without the device!”\n"
"“What about the guardian?” A man at the gates asks.\n"
"“It’s no use,” she replies. “Just go!”\n"
"That is when the screaming begins. A spray of blood splatters against the basement window. Those who escaped immediately panic and flee.\n"
"You don’t stop or look back. You run until the building has faded behind the dense, grey mist, until you can no longer hear the screams of those still inside, until your legs can barely move.\n"
"Is this the kind of “sacrifice” the Silver Twilight Lodge believes in making? And if so, what does this mean for the “binding rite” they seek to complete at the Unvisited Isle?"

"你成功地憑藉著自己的雙腿，逃出了那幢建築。就在奔跑的時候，你還能聽到莊園裡傳來雷鳴般的隆隆聲。好幾個人從你身後的大門衝了出來，全神貫注，壓根沒有看見你。其中一人對她的同伴喊道：“快出去，到未訪之島集合！不管有沒有那件儀器，我們都得施行咒縛儀式！”\n"
"“守衛者怎麼了？”門邊的一名男子問道。\n"

msgid "Every fiber of your being is stretched as the box pulls you in. However, before it can accomplish its task, the lid is suddenly slammed shut by an elderly hand. You reel backward and collapse as the pulling force ceases. When your senses finally return to you, Carl Sanford is standing over you, unflappable as ever. “I see you managed to open the device without defeating its guardian. How fortunate,” he declares. He examines the box closely, removing the key and the coin from the container and recognizing them instantly. “I had a feeling you would be a valuable asset to the Lodge, but it seems I underestimated your resourcefulness. Perhaps it is time that you learn the truth behind our organization. I have a feeling you are destined for great things.” Unexpectedly, Mr. Sanford hands the puzzle box back to you, along with the components that unlocked it. “Come with me. There is much to discuss.”"
msgstr "那箱子直想將你吸入其中，拉拽著你全身每一吋皮肉。但就在你險被吸入箱中的千鈞一髮之際，箱蓋被一位老人用手砰然合上。隨著拉拽著你的力量消失，你蹣跚著後退癱倒：你回過神來，卡爾·桑福德站在你旁邊，神色依然淡定自如。“你不曾打敗守衛者就把這東西打開了。真是走運。”他說道。他仔細檢查這箱子，從裡面取出了鑰匙和硬幣，馬上就認出了它們的來路。“我有一種預感，你會成為秘社的得力助手，之前是我低估了你的才智。或許是時候讓你了解我社背後的秘密了。我相信你是要幹出一番大事業的。”出乎意料的是，桑福德先生將機關盒連同開鎖的工具一同交還給你，“跟我來吧。我們好好聊聊。”"

"Every fiber of your being is stretched as the box pulls you in. However, before it can accomplish its task, you manage to reach out and slam the lid shut. You shudder uncontrollably as your senses slowly return to you. This box is more dangerous than you could have imagined. In the hands of the Lodge, it could have been a powerful weapon, though you’re not sure what they intended to do with it. Just then, you hear several Lodge members approaching. You quickly shift one of the room’s bookcases aside and hide behind it before they enter the room. “You’re sure you heard something in here? I don’t see anybody,” one of them says.\n"
"“Hm…” the other pauses, presumably inspecting the room for signs of intruders. “Must have been nothing.”\n"
"“It’s all right. We’re all a bit on edge since the trap box went missing. Come, we don’t want to be late for the ceremony. Tonight is an important night.” Their footfalls become softer as they depart. The man’s words linger in your thoughts momentarily. What did he mean by tonight being an important night? This could be just as important as the puzzle box they had been attempting to open. You quietly follow the two men as they head deep into the tunnels beneath the Lodge. You struggle to keep up with them while trying to keep your footsteps silent on the stone floor of the passageway. Finally, they enter a large door with the familiar three arrows of Silver Twilight emblazoned along its surface. Ritualistic chanting fills the hall from the other side. You approach softly, placing your ear against the door to listen in.\n"
"“Brothers and sisters,” an elderly voice announces, “thank you for coming to this hallowed gathering. The time we have long waited for approaches.” You recognize the man’s voice – it is Carl Sanford, president of the Silver Twilight Lodge. “For many decades, the Order of the Silver Twilight has pursued knowledge that can elevate humanity. We have defended against threats to our very existence. We have sacrificed everything for this sacred cause. Now, one of these threats terrorizes our city, and once again we must do what has to be done in order to protect it.” The crowd responds with solemn approval. “Tonight, we will complete the ritual we began many nights ago at the center of the Unvisited Isle. Tonight, we will finally bind the revenant and learn what it knows. We must not allow the secrets of AZATHOTH to be lost to those who would do humanity harm.”\n"
"The cult replies with a monotone hymn, and you take this opportunity to flee the Lodge before you are discovered. The conspiracy you have unveiled leaves you with even more questions. If the revenant Mr. Sanford speaks of is what you think it is, binding it will surely protect Arkham, as he claims. But what knowledge do they seek to learn from it?…and what in the hell is an “AZATHOTH?”"

"那箱子直想將你吸入其中，拉拽著你全身每一吋皮肉。但就在你險被吸入箱中的千鈞一髮之際，你成功夠到箱蓋，砰地把它合上。你控制不住地顫抖，久久才回過神來。這個箱子遠比你想像的更危險。要是它落到秘社手裡，就是一件強大的武器，儘管你不知道他們會用它來做些什麼。說時遲那時快，你聽到幾名秘社成員朝這兒趕來。你迅速將房間裡一個書櫃移開，趕在他們進屋之前躲在書櫃後。“你真的聽見這兒有聲音嗎？我一個人都沒瞧見。”其中一人說道。\n"
"“唔……”另外一人話音稍停，大概在觀察房間裡有沒有人闖入的跡象，“定是我聽錯了。”\n"
"“行了。陷阱盒子丢了後，咱都有點煩躁。走吧，儀式別遲到了。今晚至關緊要。”他們離開的腳步聲漸不可聞。那人的話語聲一時間迴蕩在你腦海裡。他說的“今晚至關緊要”是什麼意思？或許他們所說的事情，跟嘗試打開機關盒一樣重要。你悄聲跟隨著那兩名男子，走入秘社地下的隧道深處。你努力地讓自己跟上他們的步伐，同時盡量不在石道上留下腳步聲。最後他們進了三扇相近的窄門，門上飾有“銀暮秘社”的紋樣。門的另一頭充斥著儀式的詠唱聲。你輕輕靠近，耳朵貼在門上去聽屋内的響動。\n"
"“姊妹們，弟兄們。”一道滄桑的噪音宣佈：“感謝你們來到本場神聖的集會。我們期盼已久的時刻終於到來了。”你認出了這個聲音——是銀暮秘社的會長卡爾·桑福德。“銀暮修道會在過去的幾十年裡，苦心追尋能夠造福全人類的知識。我們曾擊退外敵，捍衛組織存亡。我們為這神聖的目標犧牲一切。而今正有外敵威脅我們的城市，我們要再一次挺身而出保衛家園。”群眾報以肅穆讚同。“今晚，我們將完成幾日前在未訪之島中央啟動的儀式。今晚，我們將縛鬼伏邪，掌握亡靈所知的一切。我們絕不容許‘阿颯拖思’的秘密落入惡人手中。”\n"
"作為回應，秘會成員開始乏味的吟詠，此時你趁無人察覺，溜出了秘會。你剛剛所發現的陰謀，讓你產生了更多的疑問。如果桑福德所說的亡靈跟你所想的一樣，那麼如他所說，將它咒縛定能保護阿卡姆城周全。但他們想要從亡靈身上得到什麼知識呢？……而“阿颯拖思”又是什麼鬼？"

"The beast that had emerged from the box was a vicious guardian, slaughtering anyone in its path. Somehow you were able to slay the creature, but the consequences were dire. Many Lodge members were gruesomely killed by the creature’s rampage before you were able to put it down. Worse, the device it emerged from was destroyed beyond recognition. You’re not sure whether it broke as a result of the beast’s emergence or as a result of its death, but either way, it is a regretful outcome. “This didn’t work as planned,” one of the robed members of the Order states matter-of-factly as you examine the crushed puzzle box.\n"
"“That’s a hell of an understatement,” another adds. She places a hand on your shoulder and gently pulls you away from the remains of the device. “Come on, that’s a lost cause,” she says.\n"
"Her partner ignores your presence and stoically addresses her. “We’ll have to get to the Unvisited Isle and complete the binding rite without the trap.” She nods and takes one last look at you before the remaining Lodge members flee the building. Is this the kind of “sacrifice” the Silver Twilight Lodge believes in making? And if so, what does this mean for the “binding rite” they seek to complete at the Unvisited Isle?"

"箱中出現的怪物正是邪惡的守衛者，遇人便殺。不知為何你竟有辦法能殺死那頭怪物，儘管後果十分恐怖。在它被你打倒之前，許多秘社成員已慘死在它的暴行之下。更糟糕的是，出現怪物的箱子已被摧毀得面目全非。你不知道它被摧毀的原因是那怪物的出現，還是那怪物的死亡，但不論原因是什麼，這結果令人扼腕。“這跟計劃的不一樣。”在你查看損壞的機關盒時，一名身著長袍的修道會成員淡然說道。\n"
"另一名成員加了一句：“你說得倒是輕巧。”她將手放在你的肩膀上，輕輕地將你從那箱子的殘骸旁邊推開，說道：“別難過，失敗是早已註定的。”\n"
"她的同伴無視你的存在，堅定地說：“我們必須前往未訪之島，沒有陷阱也得完成咒縛儀式。”她點點頭，最後看了你一眼，隨後秘社殘餘的所有成員離開了這幢建築。這就是銀暮秘社所信奉的“獻祭”嗎？若真是如此，這對他們在未訪之島試圖完成的“咒縛儀式”意味著什麼呢？"
