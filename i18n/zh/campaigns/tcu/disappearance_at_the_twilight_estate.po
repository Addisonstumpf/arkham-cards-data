"Sunday, November 22nd, 1925. Arkham, Massachusetts.\n"
"Though All Hallows’ Eve is nearly a month past, a grim melancholy lingers throughout the town. Each morning, a thick fog permeates the streets. Nights are beginning to grow longer, and if you ask around town, you’ll hear people swear that it’s getting darker, too. But despite the gloomy mood, progress continues in the sleepy town of Arkham. The election of Nathaniel Rhodes to the United States Senate has upstanding members of the community feeling optimistic about the town’s future. And tonight, at his well-appointed estate in French Hill, a man named Josef Meiger hosts the Silver Twilight Lodge’s charity gala, an annual members-only event that will turn deadly for several attendees…"

"雖然萬聖節已經過去了接近一個月，但整座小鎮裡仍有著一種可怖的陰鬱。每天早晨，街道上灞漫著濃雾。夜晚逐渐變長，要是你到鎮上問間，人們會信誓旦旦地告訴你，不光如此，夜晚還變得更暗了。儘管氛围陰鬱，阿卡姆這座冷清的小鎮裡還在繼續進行著選舉。納撒尼爾：羅兹競選美國參議員，此事使社區裡正派的民眾對小鎮的未來充滿希望。今晚，在納撒尼繭位於法蘭西山的豪華莊圆裡，一位名叫約瑟夫梅吉爾的男子在此舉辦銀暮秘社一年一度的慈善募捐晚會，僅限社員參加。而對於其中幾位與會者來說，這個夜晚將會要了他們的命.."

"“Ladies and gentlemen,” Josef Meiger announces, raising a glass of champagne in a toast. A hush descends on the room, until only the crackle of the fireplace and whispers of gossip can be heard. “Allow me to welcome you all into my home for this year’s charity gala. We have some very upstanding citizens here tonight, and I thank all of you for your hard work and generosity.” Cheers and murmurs of agreement fill the room. Many of the guests raise their glasses to Valentino, one of the most esteemed members of the Lodge this year, who sits at the Guest of Honor table, which is nearest to the fireplace.\n"
"Josef ’s assistant, Jerome, blends into the wall behind Josef, discreetly checking his pocket watch. In another corner of the room, the head housekeeper, Penny, walks from table to table, filling empty glasses and collecting dirty salad plates. “Each of you has done great deeds in the name of the Silver Twilight Lodge and our historic city,” Josef continues. “Next year, we will continue to shoulder this burden and do what must be done for the sake of progress.” Jerome steps forward quietly, interrupting Josef ’s speech with the unassuming confidence that comes from years of trusted service. He taps Josef lightly on his shoulder and shows him the time. “I’m afraid I am already out of time. Thank you all very much for attending,” Josef concludes, bowing. Polite applause rises from the audience, and Josef walks briskly toward the parlor, followed closely by his assistant. Two servants collect coats as latecomers trickle into the manor, and Gavriella—Josef ’s head of security—watches over the entrance with hard eyes and a clenched jaw. “Has Mr. Sanford arrived?” Josef asks curtly, tapping his polished leather shoe on the floor.\n"
"I’m afraid not,” Jerome replies, flipping through the last pages of the estate’s guest book. “But he should be here any minute, Mr. Meiger.”\n"
"“Good. I want there to be no problems whatsoever when he arrives; am I understood?” Josef calls out to Gavriella: “Make sure he is well protected.” Gavriella nods, patting the handle of her .45 in her shoulder holster. Josef turns his attention back to his assistant. “And have Penny make sure the main course is kept good and hot while we wait for Mr. Sanford’s arrival. Not a single slice is to be served without his presence.”\n"
"“Not even for Mr. Rivas, sir?” Jerome asks, glancing at Josef over the rim of his thick glasses. Josef pauses for a moment, considering.\n"
"“Pour Mr. Rivas another glass of champagne, and I am sure he will not complain. Also, I’m still waiting on those accounts I asked you about earlier today. Don’t forget,” Josef says, clapping his assistant on the shoulder before walking back into the banquet hall. Jerome nods obediently and heads upstairs.\n"
"Soon after, the dark mist would appear, and nothing would be the same."

"“女士們先生們。”約瑟夫·梅吉爾舉起一杯香檳敬酒致辭。房間裡突然一片寂静，只剩下壁爐的噼啪聲和低聲聞聊。“歡迎各位蒞臨寒舍，参加今年的慈善募捐晚會。今晚到場的各位良好市民，我在此對你們的辛勞與慷慨表示由衷的感謝。”歡呼聲與讚同的低語聲充斥著整個房間。秘社今年最受尊敬的成員瓦倫蒂諾就坐在壁爐旁邊的主賓席，許多賓客向他舉杯致敬。\n"
"約瑟夫的助理傑羅姆躲到約瑟夫身後的墙邊，小心翼翼地查看自己的懷錶。在房間的另一角，管家領班佩妮在餐桌之間走動，為空杯子添酒並且收走髒的沙拉盤。“在座的每個人都以銀暮秘社和這座古老城市的名羲，作出了偉大的貢獻。”約瑟夫繼續說道，“明年，我們將繼續肩負重擔，為成大計不惜一切。”傑羅姆静静地走上前來，憑藉著作為可靠助理的多年經驗，不卑不亢地打斷了約瑟夫的講話。他輕輕地拍了拍約瑟夫的肩膀，給他看時間。“恐怕我已經沒時間了。非常感謝各位的出席。”約瑟夫一邊鞠著躬一邊總結道。在觀眾禮貌的掌聲中，約瑟夫快步向會客室走去，身後緊跟著他的助理。遅到的賓客陸續進入莊園，两名侍者正在為他們收起大衣，約瑟夫的保安總管加弗瑞拉下頜緊閉，用嚴厲的眼光盯緊門口。“桑福德先生到了嗎？”約瑟夫簡短地問道，擦得锃亮的皮鞋脚尖敲打著地面。\n"
"“我恐怕他還沒到，”傑羅姆翻到莊園的賓客簿最後一頁，回答道，“但他随時可能會到，梅吉雨先生。”\n"
"“說得好。不管他什麼時候到，這兒都不能有任何問題；知道了嗎？”約瑟夫對加弗瑞拉命令道：“千萬要保護好他。”加弗瑞拉點點頭，拍了拍她肩套裡的點45手槍。約瑟夫將注意力轉向自己的助理：“還有，在桑福德先生到來之前，讓佩妮一定要保持主菜妥妥富當、熱氟腾腾。他没到之前，一盤菜都不能上。”\n"
"“先生，即使是里瓦斯先生也不能上菜嗎？”傑耀姆透遇他那厚厚的鏡片看了約瑟夫一眼，問道。約瑟夫停下來思考片刻。\n"
"“再給里瓦斯先生倒杯香檳吧，我相信他不會再抱怨的。還有，我還在等著今天早些時候問你要的賬目呢。別忘了。”約瑟夫拍拍他助理的肩膀說道，然後走回宴會廳。傑羅姆順從地點點頭，朝樓上走去。\n"

"You stand guard as instructed, waiting for Mr. Sanford to appear. By now, the remaining guests have filed into the banquet hall, and you can hear the sounds of merriment and drinking coming from beyond the wooden door behind you. You pay them no mind, remaining vigilant. Years of fighting and discipline have taught you to be ready for anything, even at a harmless banquet like this. Just as you begin to ponder whether your talents are being wasted under Mr. Meiger’s employ, a dark mist invades the parlor through the front door and the window frames, flooding the room. At first, you believe it to be only the evening fog seeping through the manor’s entryway, until you begin to notice that everything the mist touches seems to have decayed as though aged hundreds of years.\n"
"You step back cautiously, keeping a hand on the grip of your weapon just in case. Never in all your years have you seen something like this. An unnatural chill spreads throughout the room, and shivers run up your spine. As the ashen mist finishes pouring in, it coalesces into a singular form: a humanoid figure wrapped in shadows. It raises its hand and points at you with a charred, blackened finger.\n"
"You unholster your firearm and point it at the creature, allowing your training to take over. “Don’t come any closer!” you shout. The thing watching you from the entrance is unfazed. Its ethereal form begins to glide toward you, dark mist crawling over the carpet in its wake. “I warned you,” you growl, and a thunderous shot echoes through the parlor as you squeeze the trigger. The bullet rips a hole in the figure’s head like a rush of air billowing through a column of smoke. The mist stitches itself together, and the thing continues to drift your way, reaching out menacingly.\n"
"Nothing could have prepared you for combat with such an unnatural enemy. Faced with no other option, you turn and flee up the staircase nearby, pausing to squeeze off several more shots at the top. The bullets that make their target simply pass harmlessly through the ghostly figure, striking the door behind it. A few stray shots shatter a column of the staircase’s wooden balustrade."

"你遵循指示站崗，等待著桑福德先生出現。現在，其餘的賓客擠滿了整個宴會應，你能聽到身後木門另一邊傳來的歡笑聲與碰杯聲。你對這全不在意，保持警覺。多年的實戰與訓練教會了你要做好一切準備，哪怕只是這樣一場和諧的宴會。正當你開始思考接受梅吉爾先生的雇傭是不是在浪費自己的才華時，一團黑霧通過前門和窗戶進入會客室，淹沒了整個房間。一開始，你認為那只是夜晚的霧氣竄進了莊園門口，但你發覺那團黑霧觸碰過的一切事物似乎都已衰敗，仿佛過了数百年。\n"
"你謹慎地後退，一隻手始終紧握著武器以防萬一。你長這麼大從來沒有見到過這樣的景象。一股不自然的寒意擴散到整個房間，你的脊梁骨都在颤抖。當灰白色的雾氣徹底灌入，它凝聚成了奇異的形状：一個包覆在陰影中的人形。它抬起了手，用一根焦黑的手指指著你。\n"
"你從槍套中取出你的手槍，對準那頭生物，讓過往的訓練經驗接管你的身體。“别再靠近了！”你大喊。從門口進來的生物正看著你，似乎未受影響。它虚無的形體朝你滑行靠近，黑霧沿著它的尾跡爬過地毯。“我警告逼你了。”你咆哮著扣動扳機，一聲雷鳴般的槍聲迥蕩在會客腐裡。子彈在它的腦袋上撕開了一個洞，仿佛一道氣流從一柱濃煙中翻腾穿過。你作足一切準備也不是這個诡異敞人的對手。你别無選擇，轉身從旁邊的樓梯往上逃，從上方再開幾槍。子彈只是穿過了那個幽靈般的人形，打在它身後的門上，未對目標造成絲毫損傷。零星幾發打偏的子彈擊碎了樓梯木欄杆的一根柱子。\n"

"You carefully flip through the pages of Mr. Meiger’s ledger, looking for the accounts he inquired about. You have served Mr. Meiger faithfully for almost a decade, and he trusts you with sensitive information like this—a point of pride for you. While you are often curious about your employer’s business, you have never pried into his personal matters. Not until tonight, anyway.\n"
"You adjust your glasses and lean forward as you turn to the page regarding Mr. Meiger’s request. Some of the names on the list you recognize: Rivas, Gensler, Fairmont, Rhodes, Wick. But many are names you have never heard of before, let alone seen affiliated with Mr. Meiger’s work: Lindquist, Konstantinov, Magro, Atkinson, Lamar…Just how deep do Mr. Meiger’s connections go?\n"
"Strange as that may seem, it is the list of names on the page afterward that raises your hackles. While it was clear that the names on the previous page are associates of Mr. Meiger’s, or at least prominent members of the Lodge, you can only assume that this next series of names is of people your employer is…targeting. For what, you cannot say.\n"
"You stand next to Josef ’s desk and record the list in your pocket journal carefully, making sure to keep the names in the exact order they appear in Mr. Meiger’s ledger. You hope that your suspicion is nothing more than the absurd imagination of an overworked secretary. Still, something about all of this has you concerned. That, and the sudden draft of frigid air that has somehow wafted into the room. Your gaze naturally drifts to the window, at which point you scream out in shock and lose your balance, stumbling backward into Mr. Meiger’s desk.\n"
"Pressed up against the office window is a host of screaming faces emerging from the mist, or perhaps composed of it. Their ghostly hands press against the glass, their eyes hollow and empty. Your reading glasses clatter to the ground and shatter under your heel as you scramble to the other side of the office. You don’t realize that you dropped your pocket journal in the chaos until it is too late."

"你仔細翻看梅吉爾先生的賬本，查找他之前詢問的眼目。你忠心耿耿地為梅吉酮先生服務了接近十年，他将如此敏感的信息託付给你——是你的驕傲。儘管你常常對自己老闊的生意感到好奇，但你從來没有窥探遇他的私事。至少，在今晚之前是的。\n"
"你翻到梅吉爾先生問到的那頁賬目，你扶了扶眼鏡，向前湊近。你認出了列表上的一些姓名：里瓦斯、詹斯勒、費爾蒙特、羅兹、威克。但還有很多名字你從未聽遇，更不知道他們與梅吉爾先生的工作有何關聯：林奎斯特、康斯坦丁諾夫、瑪格羅、阿特金森、拉馬爾……梅吉爾先生和他們的關係有多深厚呢？\n"
"雖然這聽起來很奇怪，後一頁列出的名字讓你汗毛倒豎。前一頁的姓名明顯是梅吉爾先生的生意夥伴，或至少是秘社的傑出成員，你只能設想下一串名字曾是你老間的…”目標。你說不上來自己為什麽這麼想。\n"
"你站在約瑟夫的桌子旁邊，確保自己按照梅吉爾賬本裡列出的順序，仔细地在自己的日記上記下了這些名宇。你希望自己的懷疑只是一個秘書勞累過度之後的荒谬想像。儘管如此，這一切之中還是有什麼引起了你的擔憂。擔憂的除了那串名字，還有突然不知何故灌進房間裡的冷空氣。你的目光自然地飄向窗戶，就在這時你嚇得尖叫出聲，身體失去了平衡，跌跌撞撞後退靠在梅吉繭先生的桌子上。\n"
"緊貼著辦公室窗戶的是一群尖叫著的面龐，它們從霧裡湧現，抑或是由霧形成。它們幽靈般的手絮貼著玻璃，眼眶裡全是空洞。就在你朝這間辨公室的另一邊爬去時，近視眼镜咔嗒一聲掉落在地，在你腳邊裂成碎片。最後你才意裁到自己的隨身日記已經在混亂中丟失，但已經來不及了。"

"You sigh as the cool New England air embraces you. It has been a very stressful night: stressful enough that you’ve decided to sneak away from the clamor to grab a quick smoke before heading back to work. You rest your arms along the metal railing of the balcony, your fingers trembling as they hold your cigarette. The dreary gambrel rooftops and Victorian manors of French Hill span the view below you, the unlit windows hiding countless secrets.\n"
"You can’t remember a night in which your employer was as concerned with every little detail as he is tonight. He is normally so calm, so collected. There’s something special about tonight that has him on edge. Is it Mr. Sanford? A shudder crawls through you. For some reason, something about that man gives you the creeps. But Josef has interacted with Mr. Sanford many times before, so that cannot be the reason. What could it be that has Mr. Meiger so worried?\n"
"You are torn from your thoughts by the gathering of grey clouds overhead, swiftly blotting out the night sky. As the clouds grow ever closer, you begin to see shapes emerging from the vapor. You squint and lean over the railing for a better view. That is when you notice the true forms of the shapes in the mist: their screaming faces, their clawing hands, all writhing in torment and coming straight for you. You cry out in terror and back up against the wall as the mist envelops the building. A spectral shape emerges from the haze beyond the railing, dressed in bloodstained rags. It begs for rest in a croaking, gasping voice. Your only hope for escape is to retreat back into the manor and call for help…"

"新英格蘭的冷空氣將你擁入懷中，你歎了一口氣。今晚壓力很大：壓力大到你決定要從這嘈雜聲中溜出去，抽一小會煙再回來工作。你将手臂靠在露臺的金屬欄杆上稍作歇息，手指颤抖著夾紧香煙。向下望去是乏味的復折式屋頂和法蘭西山的維多利亞式莊圈，没有亮起的窗戶暗藏著數不盡的秘密。\n"
"在你的記憶中，老闆約瑟夫梅·吉爾從沒像今晚這樣在意每一個細節。他平時是那麼地冷靜、沉穩。今晚有些特別的事情讓他焦躁不安。是桑福德先生嗎？一股戰慄爬上你的脊梁。因為某些原因，那人身上的某些東西讓你毛骨悚然。但老闆之前與桑福德先生有過幾次接觸，所以這不是他緊張的原因。究竟是什麼讓梅吉爾先生這麼緊張？\n"
"你的思緒被頭頂凝聚的烏雲打破，它們迅速遮蔽了整片夜空。随著烏雲的靠近，你逐渐看見要霧裡浮現出一些身影。你瞇起眼睛俯在欄杆上，想看得更清楚些。這時你發現了雲霧理那些身影的真面目：它們尖叫著的面龐、向外攫奪的手臂都在痛苦地扭曲著，直直向你逼近。霧氣籠罩了整幢建梁，你驚恐大叫，後退到墙壁前。欄杆外的薄霧裡湧現出—個幽靈的身影，身披血跡斑斑的破布。它用嘶啞、喘息的聲音祈求得到安息。你逃跑的唯一希望就是返回莊围，寻求幫助……"

"“Are you going to break, or are you going to sit there admiring the cue ball all night?” you ask with a mocking smile. Your opponent sets the ivory ball back on the table with a sigh.\n"
"“I can’t help myself around ivory. You know that, Tino,” Adam replies. You rarely see Adam Gensler except during Lodge functions, but you prefer his company to that of the stuffy business types who make up most of the Lodge these days. He makes his shot, the sudden clattering interrupting the din of conversation. “Your shot, Tino. And do try to avoid hitting the nine ball first. You’re always so overeager.” Adam chuckles as he moves to the other side of the table, making way for you.\n"
"“That was one time, my friend, one time.” You roll your eyes. Truth be told, you’ve enjoyed coming to these events for the opportunity to give back to the community, not to hobnob with Arkham’s gentry. But hobnobbing has had its perks.\n"
"You lean over the table and clear your mind as you line up your shot. The room falls silent as you block out the clamor and the music, focusing all of your attention on the one ball and the corner pocket. You hold your breath and strike the cue ball. It clacks as it hits its target, and the one ball drops effortlessly into the corner pocket. “There, you see?”\n"
"It is only then that you realize the silence around you is not just in your mind. All of the light and warmth has been sucked out of the room. Adam is gone, along with everyone else who was present just moments before you took your shot. “Hello?” you call out. A dark mist coils about your ankles as you walk around the billiards table. “If this is a practical joke of some kind, it’s in awfully poor taste,” you remark. The only response is the deep growl that emerges from beneath the table. Morbid curiosity compels you to look underneath it, at which point a dark hound pounces onto your chest, savagely clawing at your torso. You react instinctively, pushing it off of your body as hard as you can. It lands on the billiards table, causing it to collapse under the creature’s weight. You slowly back up as the creature rises to its feet once again and jumps off the broken table, its hollow eyes gazing into your soul."

"“你是要休息一會兒，還是說繼續坐在這兒，用整晚的時間來觀賞這顆白球？”你面帶識諷，笑著問道。你的對手将象牙白的檯球放回桌面，歎了口氣。\n"
"“我控制不住自己想著那顆球。你知道的，蒂諾。”亞當回答說。除了秘社活動，你很少見到亞當·詹斯勒，但你更喜歡亞當的陪伴，因為比起他來，秘社裡大部分成員都是些古板的生意人。他打了一桿球，這突然的碰擊聲打斷了談話的嘈雜聲。“输到你了，蒂諾。試試先别打中九號球。你總是太遏心急。”亞當輕笑著走到桌子的另一邊，给你讓出了位子。\n"
"“我的朋友，我就幹過一次這事，就一次。”你翻了涸白眼。老實說，你参加這樣的活動是為了回饋社會，而不是為了跟阿卡姆的上流社會碰杯的。但喝酒也有它的好處。\n"
"你俯身靠近桌子，讓腦子保持清醒，瞄準好球桿。你把注意力集中到一顆檯球和角袋，將喧鬧聲和音樂聲屏退，整個房間陷入寂靜。你屏住呼吸，球桿向白球擊去。它命中了目標，輕輕鬆鬆地将目標撞入角袋。“喏，看見了沒？”\n"
"在這時你才意識到周圍的寂静不僅存在於你的腦海中。這房間裡的全部光照與温度都被抽走了。亞當不見了，在你撃球之前還在的所有人都不見了。“喂？”你大聲叫喊。你繞著檯球桌走動，同時一團黑霧纏上了你的脚踝。“要是這是在開玩笑，那這玩笑的品味真是糟糕透真。”你說道。只有桌子底下傅來的低沉咆哮聲回你。病態的好奇心驅使你向下望，這時一頭黑色的邋犬撲向你的胸口，野蠻地抓著你的身體。你本能地作出反應，用盡全力将它從你的身上推開。它落在檯球桌上，重量把桌子都壓塌了。你慢慢後退，此時那頭生物再次起身，從垮塌的球桌躍起，它空洞的雙眼凝視盯著你的靈魂。"

"“Mr. Sanford, thank you so much for coming. I know you are a busy man. Your presence at tonight’s meeting is very much appreciated.” Josef shakes Carl Sanford’s hand firmly as he speaks. Sanford merely nods. “I know you’ve only just arrived, but I have some…private matters to discuss with you, if that is all right,” Josef continues, his narrow eyes shifting back and forth between the men flanking Mr. Sanford.\n"
"“Very well.” The elderly man nods to his two enforcers, who step aside to give him privacy. He cradles his hands behind his back, his stature impressive for his age. His discerning eyes fall on Josef. “What is the matter?”\n"
"Josef leans closer. “It’s here, sir. It’s here in this very house.”\n"
"There is a quiet pause between the two men, and then Carl Sanford smiles."
