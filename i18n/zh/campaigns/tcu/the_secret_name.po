"The upstairs study of the Silver Twilight Lodge is cozy, if a little cramped. The floor is covered in a plush carpet, and several comfortable sofas and small round tables fill the warmly lit room. Portraits of world-weary Lodge members line the walls around you. Carl Sanford, president of the Lodge, sits across from you, idly swirling a glass of Merlot in his wrinkled hand.\n"
"“The Silver Twilight Lodge pursues knowledge that can help us elevate our understanding of the universe,” Mr. Sanford explains, pausing to take a sip from his wine. “The creature you encountered in Josef Meiger’s estate—its appearance is not the only peculiar happening in Arkham as of late. Tell me: have you experienced anything else recently that might be connected to these events?”"

"樓上的書房雖然稍顯侷促，但卻很舒適。在這間溫暖的房間裡，地板上鋪著一塊絨毛地毯，還擺著幾張舒適的沙發和一張小圓桌。你周圍的牆上掛著一排肖像，是厭世的秘社成員。秘社的會長卡爾·桑福德坐在你對面，皺巴巴的手裡悠閒地轉著一杯梅洛葡萄酒。\n"
"“銀暮秘社追求的知識，能夠提高我們對於宇宙的理解，”桑福德解釋說，停下來小酌一口：“你在約瑟夫·梅吉爾的莊園遇到的那隻怪物——它的出現不是阿卡姆最近發生的唯一一件怪事。告訴我：你最近經歷的事情中，有沒有可能與這幾起事件有關的？”"

"You tell Mr. Sanford about your experience last week—waking up in the middle of the woods, the strange mist that weaved throughout the trees, the witches and their spell. He leans forward and listens intently as you explain the night’s strange events, your memories still somewhat of a haze. You conclude your story, and the elderly man considers your words. “Interesting,” he says at last. “I know of this coven. They are led by a witch named Anette Mason. Their magic is no trivial thing. They have passed down arcane secrets that can manipulate the energies of the universe. It is dangerous knowledge they possess—knowledge I believe they derived from a powerful witch who fled from Salem over two hundred years ago. Does the name ‘Keziah’ mean anything to you?”\n"
"You nod. Everyone in Arkham has at least some passing knowledge of the witch whose ghost supposedly haunts the old condemned “Witch House” in French Hill. Most believe her to be a work of fiction; a tall tale meant to scare young children away from the decrepit house. Mr. Sanford’s steely gaze and humorless tone makes it clear to you that this is not the case. “Perhaps this Anette is a true descendant of Keziah, or perhaps she is simply using her name. In any event, I believe these events are connected. To that end, I have a task for you, on behalf of the Silver Twilight Lodge.” Carl Sanford rises to his feet, using his cane more for show than for balance. You rise as well, ready to perform whatever duties are necessary to get to the bottom of this mystery.\n"
"“We need as much information about this coven as we can obtain. If there is any place that will have these answers, it is the house where Keziah herself lived all those years ago.” You nod in agreement—there are too many questions you need answered. What spell were the witches casting that night in the woods? What is their motive? And what is their connection to the creature that kidnapped those four unfortunate souls? You shake Mr. Sanford’s hand and depart for the Witch House."

"你告訴桑福德你上週的經歷——在樹林裡醒來、樹林裡瀰漫著的怪霧、女巫和她們的法術。你說到那天夜裡發生的怪事時，你的記憶仍然有些模糊，他俯身專心聆聽。你說完之後，這位老人思考你說的話。“有趣。”最後他說道，“我知道這個集會。領導者是一位名叫安妮特·梅森的女巫。她們的魔法可不是鬧著玩的，她們所傳承的奥秘能夠操控宇宙的力量。這是一種危險的知識——我相信這源於兩百多年前從塞勒姆逃出来的強大女巫。你聽過“凱夏”這個名字嗎？\n"
"你點點頭。阿卡姆的每一個人多少都對那位女巫有所了解，據説她的幽靈常常在法蘭西山的“巫宅”出沒。大多數人覺得她是虛構的；一個為了讓小孩子遠離那幢老房子而編出來的故事。桑福德先生冷冰冰的視線和毫無幽默感的語氣，讓你清楚地認識到事實並非如此。“安妮特可能是凱夏真正的後裔，或者她可能只是借用了凱夏的名頭。無論如何，我相信這些事件之間是有關聯的。為此，我代表銀暮秘社交给你一個任務。”卡爾·桑福德站起身來，他的手杖更像是用來炫耀的，而不是用來保持平衡。你也站了起來，不論任務是什麼，你勢在必行，定要把這謎團弄個水落石出。\n"
"“我們需要知道更多關於女巫集會的信息。你要找的答案，一定就在凱夏多年前居住的那幢小屋裡。”你點頭表示同意——你心中有太多的問題需要答案。那晚女巫們在樹林裡施放的是什麼法術？她們的目的是什麼？和綁走四個可憐人的怪物有什麼關係？你與桑福德握手，出發前往巫宅。"

"You shake your head. You’re not sure if the events that took place in the woods are connected, or if they even really happened—some part of you still believes it was all a strange dream.

"After your confrontation with the president of the Silver Twilight Lodge, you travel to the manor of the Arkham Historical Society in Southside. You are positive that the events you experienced in the woods last week have something to do with the creature that kidnapped those four unfortunate souls. It’s just a hunch—a feeling that crawls along the back of your neck, imploring you to look away—but you’re sure that everything is connected. You’re just not sure how.\n"
"As you enter, one of the Historical Society’s many researchers greets you and asks if she can help in any way. You give a cursory description of the information you’re looking for; just enough that she can direct you where to look, but vague enough to leave your motives at the door. “I don’t know why you are researching such morbid affairs, but the records you are looking for should be in the library on the third floor,” the researcher says.\n"
"You thank her and head to the third floor, where you begin to study the history of witchcraft in Arkham. In the late 17th century, Arkham was one of the New England towns caught up in the hysteria of witch trials. Accusations of witchcraft spread like wildfire, and many of the accused were executed by hanging or burning, guilty and innocent alike. But there was one witch whose infamy rose above the rest, and whose mystical power was never in question: Keziah Mason.\n"
"You recognize the name as the ghost who supposedly haunts the old Witch House in French Hill. You had always thought her to be a work of fiction; a tall tale meant to scare young children away from the condemned house.
