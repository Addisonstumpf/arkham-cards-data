"You have been brought deep into the inner sanctum, where only the highest-ranking members of the Lodge are allowed. Mr. Sanford explains that the Order of the Silver Twilight is far older and more important than the public-facing Silver Twilight Lodge, and that their knowledge extends into the realm of the arcane and the obscure. “For many decades, the Order of the Silver Twilight has pursued knowledge that can elevate humanity. We have defended against threats to our very existence. We have sacrificed everything for this sacred cause. Now, one of these threats terrorizes our city, and we are the only ones who can stop it. You know the creature I speak of.” You nod in affirmation.\n"
"“Here is what we know: it was the witches who brought this abomination upon Arkham. We tried to stop their ritual, but unfortunately, we were unsuccessful in binding it. Now it is loose, and we must finish what we started before the witches are able to do the same. But first, I understand you may have some information for us, as well. Please, hand over what you have found. It is important that we collaborate in order to understand this situation.”"

"他領你來到深處的聖堂內室，只有最高階的秘社成員才允許進入此處。桑福德解釋說，銀暮修道會比面向公眾的銀暮秘社更為古老、地位更為重要，所掌握的知識涉及到神秘而晦澀的領域。“銀暮修道會在過去的幾十年裡，苦心追尋能夠造福全人類的知識。我們曾擊退外敵，捍衛組織存亡。我們為這神聖的目標犧牲一切。而今，又有外敵侵擾我們的城市，只有我們能夠阻止它。你知道我所說的就是那頭怪物。”你點頭同意。\n"
"“我們知道，將這可憎的怪物帶來阿卡姆的就是那群女巫。我們試過阻止她們的儀式，但很遺感咒縛沒有成功。現在術式不穩定，我們必須趕在女巫完成儀式之前將它封印。在開始之前，我知道你也有一些信息要提供。來吧，把你發現的東西說出來。我們互相合作，才能弄明白現在的情況。”"

msgid "Give Mr. Sanford everything you have found."
msgstr "將你找到的所有東西交給桑福德。"

msgid "Tell him you have nothing to show. (You are lying.)"
msgstr "告訴他你什麼都沒找到。(你在撒謊。)"

msgid "You show Mr. Sanford the evidence you’ve collected. “Hm… Yes, I see. It is as I suspected,” he murmurs as he inspects the trinkets."
msgstr "你將自己收集到的證據交給了桑福德。“唔……嗯，我明白了。正如我所料。”他一邊檢視著這些小玩意兒，一邊喃喃細語。"

msgid "Cross off each memento listed under “Mementos Discovered” in your Campaign Log."
msgstr "在冒險日誌“遺留記憶”下方劃掉所有條目。"

msgid "Check Campaign Log. <i>If the investigators rescued Josef</i> and <i>the investigators told the Lodge about the coven</i>."
msgstr "查看冒險日誌。如果記錄有<i>調查員救出約瑟夫</i>和<i>調查員將女巫集會的事情告訴秘社</i>。"

"You don’t trust Carl Sanford with these pieces of evidence. Who knows what he intends to do with them? In the hands of the president of the Silver Twilight Lodge, any one of these items could be a deadly instrument. You lie, informing him that your investigation has so far proven fruitless. He clenches his jaw and glares at you for a moment, his cold blue eyes staring daggers into yours. “That is disappointing to hear. But perhaps it is my fault; I should not have imposed such a heavy burden on a neophyte to the Order.”\n"
"Mr. Sanford rises to his feet, and the other members of the Order follow suit. He addresses the other members of the Inner Circle: “All right. We have no more time to spare. The ritual must be completed at once. We shall use the same site as before—the central pillar of the Unvisited Isle, where the barrier between this world and the next is thinnest. It is likely that the anomaly will pursue us there, so act with caution.” Then he turns back to you. “We will require your assistance as well, of course. The device you hold is the key to binding the revenant. You must use it properly when the time comes. Do you understand?” You nod in affirmation. Taking a deep breath to steel your nerves, you prepare for the journey to the Unvisited Isle—a journey toward death itself."

"你不放心將這些證據交給卡爾·桑福德。誰知道他想用這些東西做些什麼？這些東西裡，不管是哪一個落到了銀暮秘社會長的手裡，都能成為致命的殺著。於是你謊稱至今為止什麼都沒查到。他下頜緊繃，冷酷的藍眼睛像刀子一般直直盯著你的雙眼。“那可真遺憾。但這可能是我的錯；我不應該將這樣的重任強加在修道會的新人身上。”\n"
"桑福德站起身來，其他修道會成員也跟著他站起。他對核心圈的其他成員說道：“好吧。我們時間所剩無多。必須馬上完成儀式。儀式場所照舊選在未訪之島的中央石柱——現世與異界之間隔閡最薄弱的地方。異象可能還會糾纏著我們，所以要謹慎行事。”隨後他轉向你，“當然，我們還需要你的幫助。你手中的箱子正是咒縛亡靈的關鍵。時機到來的時候，你得正確地使用它。聽明白了嗎？”你點頭同意。深吸一口氣來平息緊張的情緒，你準備踏上前往未訪之島之旅——一趟死亡之旅。"

msgid "the investigators kept their mementos hidden."
msgstr "調查員隱瞞了自己發現的遺留記憶。"

msgid "Carl Sanford grins and rises to his feet. “You have proven yourself a loyal asset to our Order. I believe it is time that you ascended to our Inner Circle.” You approach and kneel before Mr. Sanford. He spreads his arms wide and declares, “I hereby appoint to you the rank of Knight of the Inner Circle. Arise once more, knight, and stand tall. You are now one of the elite guardians of humanity, keepers of the truth, and stewards of the Silver Twilight Order.” Another member of the Order offers you a folded blue robe, and you don it solemnly. “Now, I am sure you have many questions for me. We do not have a lot of time to dawdle, but you deserve answers. What do you wish to know?”"
msgstr "卡爾·桑福德笑著站了起來：“你證明了自己是修道會忠誠的一份子。現在是時候讓你晉升，加入我們的核心圈了。”你步近桑福德，在他面前跪下。他大展雙臂，宣告：“我在此任命你為核心圈的一員，授騎士爵位。站起來吧，騎士，站直。你現在是人類的精銳守衛者、真理保守者、銀暮秘社修道會的管理者。另一名修道會成員遞來一件疊好的藍色長袍，你莊嚴地將它穿上。“現在，我知道你有很多問題要問我。雖然我們沒時間閒聊，但這是你應得的，我會回答你。你想知道些什麼？”"

msgid "You may ask up to three questions of Carl Sanford before his patience wears thin."
msgstr "在卡爾·桑福德的耐心耗盡之前，你最多可以問他3個問題。"

msgid "Choose a question to ask Carl Sanford."
msgstr "選擇一個問題來詢問卡爾·桑福德。"

msgid "<i>“What is the creature?”</i>"
msgstr "<i>“那頭怪物是什麼？”</i>"

msgid "<i>“What do you want with the creature?”</i>"
msgstr "<i>“你打算對那頭怪物做什麼？”</i>"

msgid "<i>“What do the witches want with the creature?”</i>"

msgstr "<i>“你在慈善晚宴之前就知道那頭怪物的存在嗎？”</i>"

msgid "<i>“Where are the four missing people from the charity gala?”</i>"
msgstr "<i>“慈善晚宴上失蹤的四個人現在身在何處？”</i>"

msgid "<i>“…Why are you looking at me like that?”</i>"
msgstr "<i>“……你為什麼這樣看著我？”</i>"

msgid "You may only ask this question because <i>the investigators survived the watcher's embrace</i>."
msgstr "因為<i>調查員從看守人之擁下存活</i>，你只能提問這個問題。"

msgid "Finished asking questions."
msgstr "結束提問。"

msgid "“It is a powerful remnant, left behind from one who perished long ago. The witches could only have summoned it if they had a strong connection to the soul it once belonged to,” Mr. Sanford explains. “It could only be one person: Keziah Mason herself.”"
msgstr "“那是很久以前死去的人留下的，強大的鬼魂。女巫之所以能夠召喚它，是因為她們與那鬼魂的肉身有著緊密的聯繫。”桑福德解釋道，“它肯定是那個人的鬼魂：凱夏·梅森。”"

msgid "“First and foremost, we need to bind it to prevent it from doing further harm. That is of paramount importance. Once it is bound, we may be able to learn the secrets it possesses without endangering ourselves or others.”"
msgstr "“首先，我們得對其施術綁縛，阻止它繼續作惡。這是至關重要的。封印完成後，我們就能夠在保全自身和他人的前提下學習它所擁有的知識。”"

msgid "“I am sure they wish to learn its secrets, and draw from its power,” he theorizes, stroking his beard. “Perhaps allow one of their own to become possessed by the spirit, and hence gain power over life and death itself.”"
msgstr "“我很肯定，她們想要知道它的秘密，抽取它的力量。”他捋著鬍鬚，推斷道，“可能會讓那鬼魂附在其中一個女巫的身上，從而獲得超越生死的力量。”"

msgid "“In truth, yes,” Mr. Sanford admits. “But we did not know it would come to us. After interceding in the witch’s summoning rite, we investigated the spectral mist that was left behind for several days. We likely drew too much attention to ourselves, and it was drawn to our presence. Not necessarily a bad thing, in the end.”"
msgstr "“老實說，是的。”桑福德承認，“但我們沒想到它是衝著我們來的。插手女巫的召喚儀式後，便有鬼靈迷霧數日不散，我們遂展開調查。我們可能太過張揚，被它盯上了。但說到底，這不一定就是件壞事。”"

msgid "“God only knows,” Mr. Sanford replies with a sigh. “Taken by the revenant, perhaps. Or swallowed by the mist.” He considers this for a while, then adds, “I suspect that if they are still alive, they cannot be far from the revenant. For better or for worse, the anomaly seems localized around it."
msgstr "“這事只有上帝知道答案了。”桑福德歎了口氣答道，“或許，他們被歸來的亡靈帶走了。或者是被迷霧吞噬了。”他想了一會，補充道，“我猜，要是他們還活著，那他們也快變成亡靈了。異象似乎只發生在它周圍，說不清是好事還是壞事。”"

msgid "Mr. Sanford clears his throat. “I… It is nothing,” he lies."
msgstr "桑福德清了清嗓子“我……沒什麼”。他在撒謊。"
