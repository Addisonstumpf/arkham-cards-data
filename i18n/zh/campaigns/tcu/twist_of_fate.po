"You stand underneath the breach, in awe of its presence. Everything the soothsayer predicted has come to pass. “This is a matter of life and death,” she had told you. How right she was. Beyond the cosmic ingress, the nucleus of the cosmos awaits. Now you understand what dwells on the other side, gnawing hungrily at the fabric of reality: the doom of all humanity; no, not just humanity. The doom of all life in the universe.\n"
"There is a bitter taste in your mouth. Tears well in your eyes. You close your fist so hard your nails dig into your flesh. If you have to die, then die you will. But you’re not going to die sitting down."

"你站在裂口下方，對其存在感到敬畏。占卜師所有的預言都應驗了。“這關係生死。”她當時是這麼跟你說的。她說的太對了。邁進宇宙的入口，等待著你的是宇宙的核心。現在你知道了潛伏在另一頭的是什麼，它飢餓地啃食著現實世界：它是全人類的末日；不，不僅是人類的末日。宇宙中所有生命的末日。\n"
"你口中泛苦，淚盈眼眶。你握緊拳頭，指甲深深扎進肉裡。如果你必將死去，那你不會貪生。但你不會坐以待斃。"

msgid "“Keziah was beseeched to sign a book by the messenger of an ancient being. The Black Book of Azathoth.” Just the name of the thing shakes you to your core. Anette clenches her fist. “I was a fool to not have understood before. That was the source of her power. Not witchcraft, but a pact with a terrible, dark god. All of this, these incursions into our world, the broken bonds of death: it is what Keziah wanted all along. It was the silent will of Azathoth,” she says resentfully."
msgstr "“一位遠古的存在留下了信息，懇求凱夏在一本書上簽名。阿撒托斯的黑書。”光是它的名字，就讓你心靈為之震顫。安妮特握緊拳頭，“我真是個笨蛋，沒有早些明白。她力量的來源不是巫術，而是與可怕的邪神締結的契約。我們家園遭受的入侵，與亡者之間破裂的紐帶：這一切都是凱夏一直以來想要的，也是阿撒托斯的無聲旨意。”她憤恨地說道。"

msgid "“It is a gateway,” Sanford explains, “ joining our world and the greater Cosmos. According to some of the most heinous tomes I have read, at the center, there sleeps a creature known as Azathoth.” Just the name of the thing shakes you to your core. “I fear we have stirred it in its slumber. All of this, these breaches in space, these broken barriers between worlds: it is all because for just a brief moment, for one fragment of a second, we interrupted Azathoth’s dreaming. Do you understand?”"
msgstr "“這是一個入口。”桑福德解釋說，“連接著我們的世界和更宏大的宇宙。我曾讀過一些最為邪惡的書籍，書中記載著，在更為宏大的宇宙中心，沉睡著一個名叫‘阿撒托斯’的存在。”光是它的名字，就讓你心靈為之震顫。“我怕我們已把它從睡眠中喚醒。所有這一切，空間的裂口，異界之間的破碎：這一切都是因為那一刹那，那破碎的一秒鐘，我們驚動了睡夢中的阿撒托斯。你聽明白了嗎？”"

msgid "For almost an hour, you stare up into the empty abyss, pondering your options and your fate. A flock of faceless winged creatures circle the field where you sit. They almost move like vultures, waiting for your demise so as to feast on your corpse. They draw ever nearer, and you begin to wonder if they can read the thoughts that hover on the surface of your mind. Rising to your feet, you raise your arm and call out to one of them. This may be the most foolish thing you have ever done, you think to yourself. But your instinct proves to be the right move: the creatures descend on black leathery wings, landing on the wet grass in front of you. One lowers itself until it reaches the height of your shoulders, offering its back to you. Swallowing the very last of your doubts and your fear, you climb aboard the creature. With a swift flap of its wings, it carries you off into the void, beyond the limits of space…to the domain of Azathoth."
msgstr "在接近一個小時的時間裡，你凝視著這空虛的深淵，思考著自己的選擇與命運。一群長有翅膀的無臉生物在你坐的地方周圍環成一圈。它們移動的樣子簡直像是禿鷲，等待著你的死亡，好享用你的屍體。它們離你越來越近，你開始懷疑它們是不是聽見了你心頭的思慮。你站起身高舉手臂，大聲呼喚其中一頭生物。這可能是你做過的最蠢的事情，你心下暗想。但事實證明，你的直覺是正確的：這些生物扇著黑色的皮革翅膀降落在你面前濕漉漉的草坪上。其中一頭生物放低身體，剛好到你肩膀的高度，將自己的後背交給你。你放下心頭所有的懷疑與恐懼，爬到它身上。它迅速扇動翅膀，帶著你飛入虛空，超越空間的界限……進入阿撒托斯的領域。"
