msgstr "進步的代價"

msgid "Because at least one investigator has the [[Silver Twilight]] trait:"

msgstr "没有调查員擁有[[银暮秘社]]屬性："

msgid "“Ah, it’s you. I did not expect you to be here, though perhaps I should have,” Mr. Sanford says with a hint of surprise in his voice. “I regret that you had to be involved in this unfortunate affair. I did not plan for you to be a part of any of this.” You narrow your eyes. You suspect fortune had nothing to do with it. You ask him what will happen to those still trapped inside. “Human progress requires sacrifice,” he recites stoically. “It is lamentable when that sacrifice is in blood, but the price in lamentation does not outweigh the yield of our labor.”"
msgstr "“原來是你啊。我早該想到你會在這見的。”桑福德略帶驚訝地說道，“我很抱歉你被捲入到這場不幸的事件中来。你根本不在我的計劃之中。”你瞇起了自己的眼睛。你覺得這不是“不幸”，幸運在這件事上派不上用塌。你向他詢問，仍被困在辉面的人會遭遇些什麼。“人類的進步需要有所犧牲。”他堅忍地叙述道，“以鮮血為代價的犧牲固然引人悲憫，但與我們辛勞的成果相比，這種悲憫不值一文。”"

msgid "“I regret that we must meet under such… unfortunate circumstances,” Mr. Sanford says offhandedly. You narrow your eyes. You suspect fortune had nothing to do with it. You ask him what will happen to those still trapped inside. “Human progress requires sacrifice,” he recites stoically. “It is lamentable when that sacrifice is in blood, but the price in lamentation does not outweigh the yield of our labor.”"
msgstr "“我很抱歉我們得在這樣……不幸的情况下見面。”桑福德不客氣地說道。你瞇起了自己的眼睛。你覺得這不是“不幸”，幸運在這件事上派不上用場。你向他詢問，仍被困在裡面的人會遭遇些什麼。“人類的進步需要有所犠性。”他堅忍地叙述道，“以鮮血為代價的犧牲固然引人悲惘，但與我們辛勞的成果相比，這種悲惘不值一文。”"

"You didn’t come here to listen to Mr. Sanford proselytize about sacrifice. You came here for answers. You demand an explanation, but the elderly man cuts you off with a scowl. “Yes, yes. You speak of the incident last week. That was the creature’s first manifestation, and the arrival of the dark mist, which you encountered inside.” He glances at the front door to the manor and clears his throat. “The Lodge was not involved in the disappearances that occurred that night,” he explains after a short pause. “But we couldn’t exactly go to the police and tell them a creature made of mist kidnapped four people in Mr. Meiger’s household, could we? So, we had to take matters into our own hands. We suspected that creature was drawn to the crowd, so we recreated the incident in order to understand what happened—to discern its motives.” The decision to host another event at Mr. Meiger’s estate so soon after the disappearances makes sense to you now. As much as you hate to admit it, there is some logic to the plan the Lodge put into action, although you don’t particularly like being used as bait. Who knows how many innocent bystanders were put in mortal danger? Even if the goal was noble, was it worth the sacrifice?\n"
"“I hope you understand that our organization only seeks the betterment of humankind. There are harsh truths that lie beyond our five senses,” Mr. Sanford says, his expression grim. “If we are to survive and prosper, we must adapt. We must learn. We must understand. That is what our order seeks to achieve—a greater understanding of the world around us. A worthy pursuit, don’t you agree?”"

"你不是來這兒聽桑福德傳教，聽他那些關於犠性的鬼話的。你來這兒為的是答案。你讓這位老人解释，但他一臉怒容打斷了你。“行行行。你問的是上週的那件事。那是怪物第一次現身，就是你在黑霧裡遇到的那隻。”他瞥了一眼莊園前門，清清嗓子。他停了片刻，解釋道：“那晚發生的失蹤事件舆秘社無關。但我們不能直接跑到警局去，告訴他們一個霧做的怪物從梅吉爾家綁走了四個人，不是嗎？所以，我們得自己解决這事。我們懷疑它被人群所吸引，所以我們将那個事件重現，只為搞明白那晚發生了什麼——從而了解那隻怪物的目的。”你現在明白了，為什麼在失蹤事件後會這麼快決定再在梅吉爾莊園舉辦一次活動。儘管你不願意承認，秘社實施這個計劃是有理可循的，但你不太喜歡被人當成誘餌。誰知道有多少無辜的人被置於危險的境地呢？即使目標是崇高的，它值得藏牲嗎？\n"
"“我希望你能理解，我們組織只為造福人類。在我們五感之外有一些殘酷的存在，”桑福德表情冷峻地說道，“如果我們要生存、要繁榮發展，我們必須適應、研究並理解它們。這就是我們秘社所追求的——更多地了解我們周圍的世界。這是一份值得追求的事業，你不這麼認爲嗎？”"

msgid "Before you can reply, one of Sanford’s men emerges from the house behind you. He sheathes a long silver blade as he addresses Mr. Sanford. “There is no sign of Josef inside, sir.” The man eyes you suspiciously, keeping his hand on the hilt of his sword. His posture reminds you of that of a knight, stoic and rigidly disciplined. “I see,” Sanford replies. He closes his eyes and takes a deep breath before continuing. “A great loss for our order, but one we anticipated. Gather the Lodge’s belongings from inside the estate, and I will deal with the consequences.” The knight nods and heads back inside. Carl’s cold blue eyes turn back toward you. “As for you, I would ask you to leave this place at once. You have done enough harm as it is.” Before you can protest, he commands the other men nearby to escort you off the premises, and you have little choice but to comply."
msgstr "你還沒回答，桑福德手下的一名男子從你身後的房子走出。他一邊把一柄銀質長刀入鞘，一邊對桑福德說道：“先生，約瑟夫不在裡面。”那人手握著劍柄，狐疑地看著你。他的姿势讓你想到了堅忍克己、恪守紀律的骑士。“我知道了。”桑福德回應。他閉上眼睛，深吸一口氣然後繼續說道：“這是我社的重大損失，但我們早有預料。把屬於秘社的東西都從莊園裡取出來，我來承檐後果。”那位骑士點點頭，返回莊園。卡繭藍色的眼眸重新望向你：“至於你，我會讓你馬上離開這裡。你造成的傷害已經夠多了。”你還沒來得及抗議，他命令身邊的其他手下護送你離開此地，你别無選擇，只得服從。"

"You consider Mr. Sanford’s words carefully. You believe that he is telling the truth, but you’re not sure if the ends justify his means. Before you can reply, Josef steps forward. “I believe our new comrades understand the value of working together,” he says politely, standing at your side. “They could have escaped on their own, but they stayed behind to make sure members of the Lodge were safe. Surely we are of the same mind.”\n"
"“Courage is not the same as sacrifice, Josef,” Carl Sanford intones patiently. “Do they have the will to do what is truly right for all of humanity?” The elderly man turns his attention back to you, his cold eyes glinting in the moonlight. He approaches calmly, extending his hand. “Regardless, you have experienced firsthand the danger that we all face. Join us, and we can face it together. With our knowledge combined, we can protect Arkham from this threat.”"

"你仔細思考桑福德所說的話。你相信他說的是實話，但為了達到目的是否可以不擇手段，你不知道。你還沒開口回答，約瑟夫邁步向前。“我認為，我們的新同志明白攜手合作有多重要。”他站在你身邊，恭敬地說道，“他本來可以自己逃走，卻留下來確保秘社成員的安全。我們想必是一路人。”\n"
"“有勇氣，不意味著敢於犧牲，約瑟夫。”卡爾·桑福德耐心地說道，“他願意為全人類的福祉做出正確的事嗎？”老人將注意力放回到你身上，他冷酷的眼睛在月光下閃爍著光芒。他平静地向你走來，伸出手。“不論如何，你親身經歷了我們所面臨的險境。加入我們，一起面對吧。結合我們的知識，我們就能保護阿卡姆不受此次的威脅。”"

"You consider Mr. Sanford’s words carefully. You believe that he is telling the truth, but you’re not sure if the ends justify his means. Before you can reply, Josef Meiger emerges from the house behind you, flanked by two guards wearing expensive suits. One wields a long silver blade as he stands guard. The other observes the situation vigilantly, keeping one hand on the grip of a revolver holstered at his side. Josef recognizes you and addresses you curtly. “You have been poking your head where you don’t belong,” he threatens, narrowing his dark eyes.\n"

"你仔細思考桑福德所說的話。你相信他說的是實話，但為了達到目的是否可以不擇手段，你不知道。你還沒回答，約瑟夫·梅吉爾從你身後的房子走出，他左右两側是兩名身著貴價西裝的護衛。其中一名站著護衛時還擺弄著一柄銀質長刀。另一名則警惕地觀察情勢，一隻手握緊了身側的左輪手槍。約瑟夫認出了你，對你簡短地說明：“你一直在窥探不屬於你的地方，”他隧起漆黑如墨的雙眼對你出言威醉。\n"

The Lodge will handle this problem on our own. Return to your state of ignorance. But I warn you: do not get in our way. I am not an enemy you want to have.” Before you can protest, Sanford commands the other men nearby to escort you off the premises, and you have little choice but to comply."
msgstr "桑福德皺起眉頭，將手放回身側，瞇起了眼睛。“我明白了。說寶話，我有些失望。我本以為你有足夠的洞察力，明白攜手合作有多重要。但現在我意識到，我信錯了人。”他歉了口氣，視線越過你，望著約瑟夫的莊園，“好得很。秘社會自己解決問题。把這些都忘了，回去過你無知的日子吧。但我警告你：别擋我們的道。你不曾想要舆我為敵的。”你還没來得及抗議，桑福德命令身邊的其他手下護送你離開此地，你別無選擇，只得服從。"
