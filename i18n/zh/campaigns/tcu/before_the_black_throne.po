"Onward and onward, your steed carries you into the inky nightmare of the void beyond. You dare not turn and look behind you, for you know that what you see will likely break your heart, or perhaps your mind. Great polypous horrors slide darkly amidst the blackness and loneliness of the cosmos. You had hoped to marvel at a beautiful, glimmering array of stars, but instead you are left with an empty pit in your stomach, as the unabated vastness of the dark, cold universe looms before you. In the distance, a far-off melody rings its chords, a melody you could not possibly recreate in your universe with any known instrument, nor could your ears interpret its notes were it not ringing in your head this very moment.\n"
"There is a rush of air as you breach the turret of a nightmarish onyx barrier and descend into an infinite cavern of black stone and impossible architecture. The music grows as you plunge unswerving through an impossible valley, through shoals of shapeless beings, and between things that lurk and dance in the blackness beyond. You cannot help but listen to the strange music, committing each terrible, dissonant note to memory. No thought or dream of humanity can reach you here, in this place that was long ancient when Earth was born. You can only hope to guide your steed to the place where you must go… The throne upon which Azathoth itself sits."

"你的坐騎帶你一路前進，進入了彼端的虛空，那漆黑的噩夢，你不敢回頭望向身後，因為你知道，你看到的景象可能會擊垮你的內心，或是瓦解你的思維。形如水螅一般的恐怖怪物在宇宙的黑暗與孤獨中緩緩移動。你本想為這片瑰麗、閃爍的星空而驚歎，但等到依然浩瀚無垠的、黑暗而寒冷的宇宙映入你的眼簾，你只覺得自己腹中傳來一陣空空蕩蕩的感覺。遠遠傳來一段和弦，宇宙中的任何一種已知的樂器都無法重現這段旋律；要不是此時此刻在你的耳中響起，你也根本無法理解這段音符。\n"
"你們撞毀了擋路的駭人縞瑪瑙塔樓，一陣強烈的氣流隨即伴著你們下降到一處極大的洞穴，其中是黑色石塊和不可思議的建築。隨著你堅定地穿越一座不可思議的山谷，穿過成群的無形生物，穿過在黑暗中潛伏和舞動的存在，樂聲越來越強。你無法不去聽這奇怪的音樂，將每一個可怕的不諧音符都留在記憶裡。人類無法想到或夢到你所在的地方，這裡比地球誕生的時候更為久遠。你只能寄望於你的坐騎，希望它能將你帶到你必須要去的地方……阿撒托斯的王座。"

"Throughout this scenario, new locations will enter play from the top of the Cosmos, a separate deck consisting of double-sided locations. This is primarily done via the ability on each act: “[action] Spend X clues: Draw the top X cards of the Cosmos. Choose one to put into play using its connection instructions, and move to it. Shuffle the rest back into the Cosmos.”\n"
"The revealed side of each Cosmos location has a “<b>Cosmos</b> –” instruction which tells the investigator where to connect that location. (For example, “<b>Cosmos</b> – Connect above” would mean the newly drawn location should be placed immediately above the investigator’s location, whereas “<b>Cosmos</b> – Connect to the right” would mean the newly drawn location should be placed immediately to the right of the investigator’s location.)\n"
"A new location cannot enter play in a position already occupied by a location. If a location’s connection instructions are impossible to fulfill, shuffle that location back into the Cosmos and cancel the effects of the move.\n"
"“<b>Cosmos</b> –” instructions are only resolved when a location is being drawn from the Cosmos. When revealing a Cosmos location that is already in play, do not follow its “<b>Cosmos</b> –” instructions."

"宇宙牌堆是包含雙面地點的一個單獨牌堆，本場冒險期間會有新的地點從該牌堆頂上入場。地點主要通過每個場景的能力入場：“[action]花費X個線索：抽取‘宇宙’頂上的X張卡牌。選擇其中一張卡牌，按照其‘<b>宇宙</b> – ’指示放置入場，移動到其上方。將其餘卡牌洗回‘宇宙’。”\n"
"每個宇宙地點的已揭示面均有“<b>宇宙</b> – ”指示，告訴調查員該地點應該連接到什麼地方。(例如，“<b>宇宙</b> – 與上方連接”意味著新抽出的地點應立即放在該調查員所在地點的上方，而“<b>宇宙</b> – 與右方連接”則意味著新抽出的地點應立即放在該調查員所在地點的右方。)\n"
"如果一個新地點將要放到已被另一地點佔據的位置，那麼該新地點不能入場。如果一個地點的“<b>宇宙</b> – ”指示不可能滿足，將該地點洗回宇宙牌堆並取消該次抽取並放置地點的動作。\n"

"During this scenario, you will sometimes be instructed to place “empty space” into play. This is done by taking the top card of the active investigator’s deck and putting it into play facedown, in the indicated position. If there is no active investigator, the top card(s) of the lead investigator’s deck should be used, instead.\n"
"Empty space is not a location, and cannot be entered by enemies or investigators unless otherwise noted. It does, however, count as a location for the purposes of determining the distance between two locations.\n"
"A location can enter play in a position occupied by empty space. Should this happen, the empty space card is shuffled back into its owner’s deck."

"本場冒險期間，你有時會收到指示要放置“虛空格子”入場。收到上述指示時，你需要拿取當前調查員牌堆頂上的1張卡牌，將其正面朝下放置入場，放到圖示位置。如果沒有當前調查員，應改為拿取調查員隊長牌堆頂的卡牌。\n"
"虛空格子不是地點，敵人或調查員不能進入，除非有特殊說明。但是，在計算兩個地點的距離時將每個虛空格子作為一個地點計算。\n"

It is a lullaby of sorts, meant to keep the oblivious god from waking. For just a brief moment, the pipers’ song was interrupted, and Azathoth began to stir.

msgid "You refuse to allow this creature to destroy everything you have ever loved. You gather together what you need for your ritual—a bit of shadowy essence from the witches’ cloaks, a fragment of spectral mist from the wraiths you banished, and the knowledge you’ve gained from delving into Arkham’s past. Slowly, quietly, you weave your wall together, stitching darkness with blood, blood with souls, souls with onyx stone. It takes ages to complete. When you are done, your reward is oblivion. A stillness and silence so pure, so perfect, no disturbance can penetrate it. The barrier cannot hold Azathoth—nothing truly can—but perhaps now it will not stir when fools on Earth call forth its name or draw from its power. With your task complete, you turn and face the darkness, summoning your steed. It is time to go home."

You cannot kill it, and even attempting to harm it would only risk stirring it. Desperate, you turn to Keziah’s Black Book for answers. A quill appears in your hands as you open the tome, and a voice from beyond reaches your ears. “Sign it with your blood. Take a new secret name, and your desire shall become truth. You and your world will be spared.” You know it is the voice of evil, the voice Walter Gilman heard which surely led to his demise, the voice which seduced Keziah Mason and led to this path in the first place…but what other choice to you have?"
