"Ever since your encounter with the ghost in the Witch House, you have been forced to reconsider everything you know about life and death. Keziah Mason died over two hundred years ago, but her spirit remains in the spectral mist—the same mist you encountered in Josef Meiger’s manor. One question lingers in your mind as you consider the events that have transpired: Does Keziah’s spirit linger because of the mist, or is the mist caused by her presence? Which is the disease, and which the symptom?\n"
"The more you delve into Arkham’s history of witchcraft and persecution, the more restless you become. Night after night, you are assaulted by terrible dreams—dreams of death and decay, of guilt and sin. There is an evil that dwells in this city, an evil that has long remained hidden in the darkness of Arkham’s past. What’s worse, your inquiry has reached an impasse. You believe that if you can find the coven of witches you saw in the woods that fateful night, you might be able to learn more about Keziah Mason or of this unspoken evil.\n"
"As you go through your morning routine, your eyes drift across one of the smaller headlines of today’s newspaper: “Ghost Sightings on Hangman’s Hill? Residents of Uptown claim to have seen human shapes in the thick fog emanating from Hangman’s Brook…” It couldn’t be a coincidence, could it?\n"
"Then the realization dawns on you—if it is witches you seek, the only place you can be certain to find them is six feet underground, in the place where professed witches were executed all those years ago. Searching for specters in a graveyard may not be your safest bet, but you’re not sure one can stay safe in this city anymore."

"自從在巫宅遇鬼，你不得不重新思考你對生與死的一切認知。凱夏·梅森死了超過兩百年，但她的靈魂留在了鬼靈迷霧之中——也就是你在約瑟夫·梅吉爾莊園遇到的那團霧。當你細想發生的一系列事件，一個問題縈繞在你的腦海裡：凱夏的靈魂是因為那團迷霧才徘徊不散，抑或是她的存在導致了迷霧產生？究竟哪一個是因，哪一個是果？\n"
"你越是深入研究阿卡姆的巫術和迫害歷史，越是焦躁不安。你每夜每夜被恐怖的夢所襲擊——夢裡盡是死亡和衰敗，愧疚和罪惡。這座城市裡潛伏著一股邪惡，一直隱藏在阿卡姆的黑暗往昔之中。更糟糕的是，你的調查陷入了僵局。你認為，要是你能找到那晚你在樹林裡看見的女巫集會，你或許就能夠更加地了解凱夏·梅森，或者這難以言喻的邪惡。\n"
"在進行早上的日常工作時，你的眼睛掃到今天報紙上的一個小標題：“在絞刑者山丘目睹幽靈？上城區居民聲稱在絞刑者河邊散發的濃霧中看見了若干個人影……”這不可能只是個巧合，對吧？\n"
"這時你才恍然大悟——如果那就是你要找的女巫，那你唯一確認能夠找到她們的地方就在地下六英呎，傳聞中多年以前處決女巫的地方。在墓地裡找幽靈或許不是最安全的法子，但你不確定繼續呆在城裡是否安全。"

"During the setup of this scenario, two encounter decks are constructed: a “standard” encounter deck and a “spectral” encounter deck. Generally speaking, whenever an investigator would interact with the encounter deck, that investigator should use the standard encounter deck.\n"
"However, at a certain point during this scenario, locations may flip over to their [[Spectral]] side. While an investigator is at a location with the [[Spectral]] trait, that investigator should use the spectral encounter deck instead of the standard encounter deck for all purposes, unless otherwise noted. This includes drawing cards from the encounter deck, as well as searching, looking at, revealing, or otherwise interacting with the encounter deck (or encounter discard pile) in any way. This also includes abilities that trigger when the encounter deck runs out of cards. If an effect specifically refers to the standard encounter deck or spectral encounter deck, it interacts with the specified deck regardless of the investigator’s location.\n"
"Each of the two encounter decks have their own discard pile. Whenever a card with the [[Spectral]] trait would be discarded, it is placed in the discard pile for the spectral encounter deck. All other encounter cards are discarded to the discard pile for the standard encounter deck.\n"
"<i>Note: Flipping a location over from one side to another during this scenario does not “reveal” the new location.</i>"

"在本場冒險的設置階段，構築2個遭遇牌堆：1個“基礎”遭遇牌堆，1個“幽靈”遭遇牌堆。一般來說，調查員將要與遭遇牌堆互動時，該調查員應該使用基礎遭遇牌堆。\n"
"但是，在本場冒險的一個特定時間點，地點卡可能翻面至[[幽靈]]面。調查員位於帶有[[幽靈]]屬性的地點時，該調查員在任何情況下都不使用基礎遭遇牌堆，改為使用幽靈遭遇牌堆，除非有特殊說明。包括從遭遇牌堆抽取卡牌、查找、查看、翻開或其他任何形式與遭遇牌堆(或遭遇棄牌堆)的互動，都使用對應的遭遇牌堆。遭遇牌堆用完時觸發的能力也正常觸發。如果一個效果特別指明是基礎遭遇牌堆或幽靈遭遇牌堆，該效果與對應的牌堆互動，不論調查員位於什麼地點。\n"
"上述兩個遭遇牌堆分別擁有各自的棄牌堆。帶有[[幽靈]]屬性的卡牌將被棄掉時，將其放在幽靈遭遇牌堆的棄牌堆。其他所有遭遇卡被棄掉時放入基礎遭遇牌堆的棄牌堆。\n"

No other spiteful ghosts emerge to haunt you, and the witches who summoned them have retreated into the shadows once more. You hope that you have done enough to prevent the rest of Arkham to succumbing to this horror."

"Resigned to your fate, you fall to your knees. The mist parts. Time slows to a crawl as the watcher emerges. Its spectral form glides along the ground, approaching with the slow surety of a ticking clock. You close your eyes, unwilling to look upon your killer. Your fingers dig into your palm, and you brace yourself.\n"
