You don’t know what rests within the hill, but it feels older than this world, and it seems like it is watching you. You dare not turn to face the barrow, yet you know you cannot leave it, so instead you endlessly patrol it. In the surrounding hedgerows, you catch glimpses of twisted shadows darting to and fro, but whenever you turn your torch upon them, they vanish. You begin to run but are frozen by a loud knock from behind you. When you turn, the fog parts, and you finally see the base of the hill, where a heavy door of weathered slate calls to you."

You push all of your chips into the center and reveal your king-high straight. “What a shame.” He tsks, revealing a pair of twos. “It appears you have lost everything.” You protest, pointing to your superior hand, but when you examine it again, it has changed. The figures on the face cards are now monstrous shapes with no eyes, many mouths, and tentacled arms. “9♥-10♣-D♦-C♠-N[auto_fail],” the cards read.

With each step you take, the flora along the path atrophy, following no laws of nature. Flowers once bloomed in your wake; now they shrivel as you pass. Vines wither and die. The wisps mock you for your ignorance, yet you do not slow your pace. As you look upon the fair trees, their leaves begin to fall. The once-green grass is dry, brown, and cracked. But even should the whole forest die, it will be worth reaching the other side. When you do, the trail ends abruptly at an ornate wooden door carved into the trunk of a great redwood."

Under the chandelier sits an ornate doorway, its gilded lattices forming the depiction of a fox in a forest."

All of this—the cold casket, the mourning friends and family—it is all because of you. But when you open the casket, there is no body inside: only a long stone passageway leading deep underground.

Although you cannot seem to read any of the words, you are utterly absorbed by the tale the pages weave. Your surroundings fade into triviality as time passes. Nothing matters but the shapes of the crimson ink; all else is meaningless in the face of such stark truths. All around you, the library burns to its foundations.

In the blink of an eye, you are consumed whole by the mire, yet you are still falling ever downward. Eventually, you are deposited onto a stone floor along with a small mudslide. You find yourself in a sealed chamber, lit by the paleblue glimmering of strange hieroglyphs. The symbols frame an intricate golden door: the door to the crypt you’ve been searching for."

Exhausted, you manage to rise to your feet, brushing off the dirt caked on your clothing. “You’re lucky you weren’t harmed before we arrived,” a human voice calls out to you. It belongs to a blond-haired man in a brown traveling coat, who leans against a nearby tree. “These woods are not forgiving to the faint of heart.” The scarred cat walks to the man’s side, and the man leans over to pet its back.\n"

It is a safe place, relatively speaking. There you may recover from your ordeals.” He turns to the cat and utters a word in an odd language—a password of sorts, you suspect—but the cat simply wanders off toward a hedge, where you see several other cats banded together. “Do it yerself,” it replies.\n"

The creatures timidly drop their “tribute” of birds in front of the cats and quietly depart. “My apologies on behalf of the Zoogs,” the man says as he approaches. “They are curious creatures, and not usually so…agitated. It is good that we showed up when we did.” The leader of the cats jumps on a tree stump and adds, “Yes, yes. Them vile Zoogs have done their part, now let’s do ours and leave this forsaken place. What say yeh?”\n"
"You cannot contain your excitement. Zoogs, talking cats—everything you have read about is real. You begin to ask the man more about this world, but he cuts you off. “I will explain in due time. For now, we must follow the path to the town of Ulthar. It is a safe place, relatively speaking. There you may recover from your travels.” He turns to the old, scarred cat and utters a word in an odd language—a password of sorts, you suspect—and the cat replies with a quick nod. The rest of the cats, tribute in mouth, take a protective circular formation around you, and together you escape from the eaves of the enchanted forest."

"這些生物互相嘰嘰喳喳叫著，過了一會，它們中的好幾十隻朝著道路對面的大樹逃走了。不久它們又再回來，嘴裡叼著各種松雞、鵪鶉、野雞。你幾乎可以肯定，你瘋了。然而，這怪異的景象還在繼續。它們膽怯地將自己的鳥類“貢品”放在貓群前，然後安靜地離開。“我為祖格鼠所作的事向你道歉。”男子走近並說道，“它們是一種好奇的生物，通常不會那麼……激動。還好我們及時出現。”貓群的頭領從一棵樹樁跳下，點頭說：“對，沒錯。可惡的祖格鼠既已進貢，現在該吾等動身，離開這個鬼地方。諸位怎麼說？”\n"
"你無法按捺自己的激動。祖格鼠、會說話的貓——你在文章裡讀到的一切都是真的。你開始詢問那名男子，問他更多關於這個世界的事情，但他打斷了你：“我會在適當的時候解釋的。現在，我們得循著道路前往烏撒之城。相對來說，那裡很安全。到了那裡你可以好好歇息，從旅行中恢復過來。”他轉向那隻帶有傷疤的老貓，用一種奇怪的語言說了一句話——你懷疑那是某種密碼——而那隻貓迅速地點了一下頭作為回應。其他的貓嘴裡叼著貢品，在你周圍站成一圈以保護你，然後帶你一起逃出了這片被施了魔法的森林。"

"You hold a hand up to the new visitors, believing that you can defuse this situation on your own. Had you known these rodent-like creatures were intelligent all along, you might have tried to communicate with them much earlier. You inform them that you are just travelers in this faraway land and that you simply wish to pass through peacefully. The creatures chitter among themselves for a moment: “They are kind!” “They are not with the black cat after all!” “Summon the Council of Sages!” After a short while, several more of them appear, each with withering grey fur and a frail, thin body. The eldest one peeks behind you and states that they will aid you if you get the cats to leave.\n"
"Somehow, you contain your disbelief and politely ask the cats to come back another time. “All right,” the scarred cat replies, “but you ain’t seen the last of us.” The cats retreat to the edge of the woods, though their human companion stays behind with you. Once the cats are out of earshot, one of the elders offers you a gourd of what appears to be fermented tree sap, which you accept graciously.\n"
"“It is the wine of the moon-tree,” the man behind you explains quietly, stepping forward. “The Zoogs do not give such gifts lightly. They are curious creatures, but not without wisdom. Now that you may speak freely with their elders, try asking them a question. They know more of the dealings of this land than you might think.”\n"
"You describe the author Virgil Gray and ask the Zoogs if they have seen a man fitting that description pass through these woods. You add that he would have walked this path many times. A hush falls over the Zoogs, and some of them immediately depart into the deep foliage. “We have met this human,” one of the elders replies with a flutter just louder than a whisper. “He often comes this way. He is kind but foolish. Take the road to Ulthar. You may meet him.” Then it adds with a low growl: “…but beware the cat that follows him. All cats are liars, but the black cat especially.” You thank the ancient Zoog for its wisdom and depart, led by the blond man and his feline escort. The cats eye you suspiciously after your discussion with the Zoogs. The man breaks the tension. “If you are heading to Ulthar to find this friend of yours, allow me to guide you there. It is a safe place, relatively speaking. There you may recover from your travels.”\n"
"Zoogs. Talking cats. This can’t all be a figment of your imagination. Somehow, you can see a layer of truth beneath all of this absurdity. For better or for worse, the Zoog council has confirmed the reality of your situation: the Dreamlands are real, and Virgil Gray is here."

"你相信單憑自己就能化解眼前的局面，舉手示意來客不要介入。如果你早知道這些嚙齒類動物一直以來都很聰明，你或許會早些嘗試與它們交流。你告訴它們，你是從遙遠的地方來的旅行者，你只是想通過這裡，不想引起任何矛盾。它們嘰嘰喳喳地聊了一會：“他們沒有惡意！”“看來他們和黑貓不是一夥的！“召喚賢者議會！”過了一會，又出現了幾隻老鼠，它們身體瘦弱，長著乾枯的灰色毛髮。最年邁的老鼠偷偷看向你身後，說如果你能把貓弄走，它們就會幫助你。\n"
"不知怎的，儘管你滿腹疑竇，還是禮貌地請貓下次再來。“好吧。”帶有傷疤的貓答道，“但今次不會是我們最後一次見面。”貓群朝著森林邊緣撤退，但它們的人類同伴還留在你身後。等貓群聽不到這裡的聲音，其中一隻老鼠長者遞給你一個葫蘆，裡面盛的像是發酵的樹汁，你欣然收下。\n"
"“這是用月之樹釀成的酒。”你身後的男子朝前走了一步，悄聲解釋道，“祖格鼠不會輕易送出這樣貴重的禮物。它們是好奇的生物，但並不愚蠢。現在你可以和它們的長者盡情暢談了，試著問問它們問題吧。它們可比你想象中更了解這片土地的事情呢。”\n"
"你描述那位作家維吉爾·格雷的樣貌，並問祖格鼠有沒有看到他從樹林裡經過。你補充說，那名男子曾多次走過這條路。鼠群一片寂靜，隨後一些老鼠立即逃進了茂密的樹葉之中。“我們見過你說的這個人。”其中一隻老鼠長者話音顫抖，用只比耳語大聲一點點的聲音說道。“他常常從這條路來。他人不錯，就是有點傻。往烏撒之城去，你或許能遇上他。”然後它低聲咆哮著加了一句：“……但要當心那隻跟著他的貓。所有的貓都是騙子，但黑貓尤其狡詐。”你感謝遠古祖格鼠為你指點迷津，然後便在金髮男子和他的貓咪護送之下離開。你和祖格鼠交談過後，貓群狐疑地看著你。男子開口打破了這股緊張感：“要是你想去烏撒找你那位朋友，請允許我帶你到那兒去吧。相對來說，那裡很安全。到了那裡你可以好好歇息，從旅行中恢復過來。”\n"
"祖格鼠。會說話的貓。這不可能全是你想象出來的。不知道為什麼，你知道真相就在這怪誕場景背後。不論如何，你已經從祖格鼠賢者議會那裡確認了你如今的情況：幻夢境是真實存在的，而維吉爾·格雷也在這裡。"
