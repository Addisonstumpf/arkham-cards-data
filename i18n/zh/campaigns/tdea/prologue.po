"Something odd was happening in Arkham, Massachusetts.\n"
"Typically, this would not be a surprise to the residents of the dreary New England town. Indeed, Arkham has always been well-known for its strange—some would say supernatural—occurrences. The nature of this particular circumstance, however, was anything but typical.\n"
"It all began in the latest issue of <i>Tales from Nevermore</i>. A writer by the name of Virgil Gray described a journey he had taken in his dreams—a journey he claimed was not a work of fiction on his part. He wrote of a long, spiraling staircase, an unbearably hot pillar of sentient fire, a tree that came from the moon, and a curious talking cat…among other things equally difficult to believe. But it wasn’t this extraordinary tale that first drew your attention. Soon after Virgil’s tale was published, <i>Tales from Nevermore</i> began to receive and publish letter after letter from those who had read Virgil’s story and claimed to have experienced the same exact dream. Before long, the Arkham Advertiser picked up the story, and news of this strange phenomenon reached the ears of experts.\n"
"Virgil Gray was convinced to undergo therapy at the local asylum, and many more who shared in the writer’s psychosis were committed as well. The prevailing theory among academics is that Virgil’s dream felt so real that he could not separate fact from fiction, and his writings spread his delusions to others like a form of shared hysteria. You remain unconvinced. After all, there is much that is not known about the simple act of dreaming. Medical experts have wildly differing theories on the state of one’s brain during sleep. Recently, experts like Sigmund Freud have proposed that dreams are manifestations of one’s subconscious desires, fears, or obsessions. Fortune tellers, for their part, have long believed that dreams can be sifted and interpreted in order to tell the dreamer’s past or future. But if these theories are true, how could multiple parties—all from very different walks of life—have the same shared experiences in their dreams? What if our modern understanding of sleep is all wrong? What if there really is a place our consciousness travels to when we sleep—a land of dreams that exists beyond our waking world?\n"
"You and your companions have gathered together to get to the bottom of this strange phenomenon. If others in town can travel to another world in their dreams, perhaps you can, too. You’ve re-created the circumstances of Virgil’s journey perfectly. If all goes well, half of you will take the trip to this “dreamland” and back. The rest will stay in the waking world, studying your companions’ sleep patterns to ensure nothing goes wrong…"

"馬薩諸塞州的阿卡姆鎮發生了一些怪事。\n"
"通常來說，這座陰鬱的新英格蘭小鎮上的居民並不會對其大驚小怪。阿卡姆的確一直以怪事——有人稱之為超自然現象——著稱。然而，這次的情況實際上前所未見。\n"
"一切要從最新一期《傳奇故事》說起。一位名叫維吉爾·格雷的作家寫下了自己夢中經歷的一次旅行——他聲稱這不是自己編造的小說。他描寫了一條長長的螺旋樓梯、一柱灼熱難當、似是活物的火焰、一棵來自月球的樹、一隻會說話的古怪貓……還有其他難以置信的景象。但最初吸引你注意力的並不是這篇非同尋常的故事。維吉爾的故事刊登後不久，《傳奇故事》陸續收到並刊登了一封封信件，寄信人閱讀維吉爾的故事後聲稱經歷過一模一樣的夢境。不久，阿卡姆報社報道了這則故事，以及專家們也得知了這一奇怪現象的新聞。\n"
"有人說服作者維吉爾·格雷到當地的精神病院接受治療，許多和他一樣精神錯亂的人也被送進了精神病院。學界普遍認為維吉爾的夢境真實到他本人分不清現實與虛幻，而他的作品將他的幻覺傳播給他人，使讀者也變得歇斯底里。你仍然無法接受這一結論。畢竟，人類對於做夢這個行為仍不甚了解。對於睡眠中的大腦狀態，醫學專家的各種理論之間存在較大分歧。近來，包括西格蒙德·弗洛伊德在內的許多專家認為，夢是一個人潛意識裡的慾望、恐懼或執念的表現。預言家們則一直以來都相信，通過篩選和解釋夢境，就能得知入夢者的過去和未來。但是，如果這些理論都是真的，那麼怎會有那麼多人——來自各行各業的人——都夢到同一段經歷？假如當代對睡眠的所有理解都是錯的呢？假如我們的意識在睡夢中真的能到達一個地方——存在於清醒世界以外的夢之國度呢？\n"
"你和你的同伴們聚集起來，徹查這一怪事的真相。如果說這座鎮上有人能進入夢中世界，那麼，或許你們也能。你已經夢到了維吉爾所經歷的夢境，完全一致。如果一切順利，你們中的一半人將出發前往“幻夢境”並返回。其餘的人將留在清醒世界，研究同伴的睡眠模式以確保一切正常……"
