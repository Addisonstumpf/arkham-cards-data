"<i>Following scenario 1–A, the dreamers travel beyond the Enchanted Woods…</i>\n"
"As you travel out of the Enchanted Woods, you pass through rolling green meadows under a bright-blue, cloudless sky. You speak with the blond-haired man—who introduces himself as Randolph Carter— for several hours along your journey south. You pass through a town Randolph calls Nir and over a stone bridge spanning a wide river. Since the man seems friendly and knowledgeable about both your world and this one, you explain to him your situation: that you had followed the writings of a man named Virgil Gray to reach this strange land, in order to see for yourself the truth of his story. “There is a place in Ulthar where you may yet meet this man for yourself,” Randolph responds. “When we reach Ulthar, I will show you.”\n"
"The town of Ulthar is not quite what you had imagined. The border of the town is marked by a cobblestone road separating its quaint cottages from the rolling green meadows beyond. Inside the town, narrow cobbled streets are filled almost to capacity with cats of all kinds and colors, which part as you approach. Old peaked roofs and overhanging upper stories arch over the hilly streets; the entire village seems a haphazard cluster of homes and old-fashioned businesses. As you reach the town square near the center of the village, Randolph stops and addresses you with a youthful smile. “Welcome to Ulthar,” he proclaims. “As I mentioned before, you are quite safe here. There is but one paramount law to keep in mind as you traverse this place: in the town of Ulthar, no one may kill a cat.” Given how utterly packed the streets are with cats, you wonder aloud if this is indeed a town run by cats. “Not quite,” Randolph replies, pondering your words, “though I suppose one might call it the center of cat society here in the Dreamlands. The reason for that law’s existence is a story for another time. First, come—I have a feeling we’ll find this ‘Virgil’ fellow you speak of at Einar’s.”\n"
"Randolph leads you through the town square, which is surrounded by buildings adorned with cat motifs in the form of statues, signs, and even stained-glass windows. You eventually arrive at one such building bearing a sign that reads “Einar’s Place.” Inside is a medieval-style tavern filled with long wooden tables. You spot several patrons and three times as many cats. One such patron at the wooden counter feeds one of the cats small strips of dried meat. He is a handsome man in his early thirties, with short dark hair, a strong jaw, and sharp cheekbones. You recognize him instantly as the writer Virgil Gray. In the back of your mind, you wonder if this chance meeting is merely an act of fortune or something preordained, for good or for ill.\n"
"Regardless, you approach the man and introduce yourself, along with Randolph. Virgil shakes your hand and Randolph’s with a joyful smile. “Well met, fellow dreamers!” the writer says, a hint of boyish excitement in his voice. “It is wonderful to meet more fellow believers. I had become so sick and tired of reading about my supposed ‘illness’ in the papers.”\n"
"You nod your head in agreement and inform Virgil that you intend to find some proof of this discovery to bring back to the waking world. “Don’t you think I tried that?” he replies, stymied. “Sadly, it is impossible for one who is asleep to bring anything from this realm into the real world. This is all imagination, you see. Ideas, concepts, fantasies. You cannot hold a thought in your hands, can you?”\n"
"Randolph interjects. “There is a place within the Dreamlands that may hold the proof you seek. I have seen it in my dreams. I visited there three times, each time just a fleeting moment before I was snatched away by the rising sun…but try as I might, I cannot find the way again. I have spent many nights searching.”\n"
"“Oh?” Virgil asks, intrigued. “And what is this place?”\n"
"“It is a marvelous city,” he describes, his eyes aglow with wonder, “golden and lovely like nothing I have seen before or since. A city beyond the peaks of the unknown mountain Kadath, where no one has ever set foot before. There, veiled within the clouds and crowned by stars, lies the onyx castle of the Great Ones.”\n"
"Virgil idly pets the cat on the countertop next to him as he is absorbed by Randolph’s tale. It is a slender creature with lustrous black fur, dark as the void of space itself. “Then we must find this place! Even if it does not have the proof we seek, it sounds like the adventure of a lifetime. Enough to fill a hundred pages, or more!”\n"
"You tell Virgil and Randolph that before you commit to such an adventure, you must return to the waking world and tell your companions about your experiences. Just then, another voice, cryptic and quiet, chimes: “Oh, you can’t wake up. The eye is upon you now.”\n"
"You and the others spin your heads around, searching for the source of the voice. The barkeeper? Another patron? Then Virgil’s black cat stretches and sits up, its piercing yellow eyes reflecting the light of the sun through the window outside. “I have waited a long time for you to seek Kadath,” it says.\n"
"“You can talk?” Virgil says, nearly toppling over his stool as he jumps in surprise.\n"
"“I’m a cat, you dolt. Of course I can talk,” the black cat replies, licking its paw out of boredom. “You have met a thousand cats from Ulthar, and now you are surprised?”\n"
"“But…I thought…” Virgil wipes his brow with his palm.\n"
"“Never mind him,” the black cat says, addressing you directly. “I assure you, you cannot cross back into the waking world until you find Kadath. It is your only way out. In the meantime, I will return and tell your companions about the quest ahead of you.” It hops off of the countertop and walks confidently toward the exit. “Though I imagine their task will be even more arduous…”"

"<i>在冒險1-A之後，入夢者走出了魔幻森林……</i>\n"
"你走出魔幻森林後，經過一片連綿起伏的翠綠草地，頭上是萬里無雲的蔚藍天空。往南方前進的過程中，你與那名自稱倫道夫·卡特的金髮男子聊了好幾個小時。你經過了一座被倫道夫稱為涅爾的小城，走過一條橫跨大河的石橋。因為他看起來很友善，並且對於你的世界和這個世界都十分瞭解，於是你向他說明你的情況：你隨著一位名叫維吉爾·格雷的人所寫的文章來到這個奇怪的地方，是為了親眼確認他的故事是真是假。“你或許能在烏撒的某個地方見到他。”倫道夫接道，“等我們到了烏撒，我會帶你到那兒去的。”\n"
"烏撒之城和你想象中的不太一樣。這座小城的邊界是一條鵝卵石路，這條路隔開了古樸的農舍與連綿起伏的草地。在這座小城中，狹窄的鵝卵石街道上幾乎全是各種各樣、形形色色的貓，你一走近它們就散開了。傾斜的街道上方拱懸著幾層尖屋頂的樓房；整個小城似乎全是雜亂無章的住宅群，並且在這兒經營的都是些老式行業。你來到城中心的廣場時，倫道夫停下腳步，露出充滿朝氣的微笑向你致意：“歡迎來到烏撒。”他宣告道，“就像我之前提到的，在這兒你會比較安全。你在這兒只需要遵守一條至高法律：在烏撒之城，任何人都不能殺害貓。”想到街道上全是貓，你大聲發問這座小城是不是被貓統治的。“不完全是。”倫道夫思考著你說的話，答道，“雖然我想人們可能會把這裡稱為幻夢境的貓界中心。下次再跟你說那條法律是怎麼來的。先過來——我感覺，你說的那個‘維吉爾’老哥就在艾納酒館。”\n"
"倫道夫帶你穿過廣場，這周圍的建築物都裝飾有貓咪元素，包括雕像、標誌，甚至連彩窗上也是。最後你來到一幢有著“艾納酒館”招牌的建築前。裡面是中世紀風格的小酒館，擺滿了長長的木桌。你注意到這裡有幾名客人，還有數量是他們三倍的貓咪。木質吧檯旁邊，一名客人正在用小條的肉乾餵貓。他相貌英俊，像是三十出頭，留著黑色短髮，有著剛毅的下頜和高高的顴骨。你馬上認出了他就是那位作者，維吉爾·格雷。在你內心深處，你好奇這次相遇究竟是巧合還是命運的安排，是好事還是壞事。\n"
"不論如何，你和倫道夫一同走近他並作自我介紹。維吉爾臉上帶著喜悅的笑容，與你二人握手：“很高興見到你們，入夢者同道！”作者說著，話語聲中帶著一絲孩子氣的激動，“見到更多相信我的朋友真是太好了。我已經厭倦了報紙上關於我所謂‘疾病’的報道。”\n"
"你點頭表示贊同，告訴維吉爾你來這裡是為了從這次探索中找到一些證據，將它們帶回現實世界。“你以為我沒試過這麼做嗎？”他挫敗地回道，“可悲的是，一個睡著的人是沒法把這個世界的任何東西帶回清醒世界的。你眼前的這一切都是想象出來的。想法、概念、幻象。難道你能把腦子裡的想法握在手裡嗎？”\n"
"倫道夫插嘴道：“幻夢境裡有一個地方，或許有你想要的證據。我在我的夢裡見過那個地方。我到過那裡三次，每一次都只待了一瞬，馬上就被升起的太陽喚醒了……但不論我怎麼努力，我都找不到去那兒的路。我已經花了好多個夜晚來尋找。”\n"
"“噢？”維吉爾好奇地問道，“那又是什麼地方？”\n"
"“那是一座奇妙的城市，”他雙眼發亮，描述道，“那裡金碧輝煌，令人心馳神往，不同於我以往見過的每個地方。它位於不為人知的卡達斯山脈的頂峰之上，從未有人踏足。那裡坐落著一座屬於諸神的縞瑪瑙城堡，它隱藏在重重雲霧之中，萬千星辰為它加冕。”\n"
"維吉爾沉醉在倫道夫的講述中，一邊漫不經心地撫摸著桌上靠近自己的貓咪。那是一隻苗條的貓咪，一身黑毛油光水滑，黑如宇宙虛空。“那麼我們必須找到那個地方！就算那裡沒有我們要找的證據，這聽起來就像一場此生不再有的冒險。這足夠我寫上一百頁，甚至更多！”\n"
"你對維吉爾與倫道夫說，你得回到清醒世界把你的經歷告訴同伴們，才能加入這場冒險。就在這時，響起了另一道神秘而安靜的聲音：“噢，你無法醒來。那隻眼睛正盯著你。”\n"
"你和其他二人轉頭到處看，尋找著聲音的來源。是酒館老闆嗎？還是別的客人？維吉爾的黑貓舒展身子，坐了起來，它那敏銳的黃色眼睛就像是窗外的陽光。“我等你們尋找卡達斯等了很久。”它說道。\n"
"“你會說話？”維吉爾驚訝地說道，嚇得跳了起來，差點從高腳凳摔了下去。\n"
"“你這呆子，我是貓，當然會說話，”黑貓一邊無聊地舔著爪子，一邊答道，“你都見過上千隻烏撒的貓了，怎麼現在才吃驚？”\n"
"“但……我以為……”維吉爾用手掌擦了擦自己的額頭。\n"
"“别管他了。”黑貓直接對你說，“我向你保證，你找到了卡達斯之後才能回到清醒世界。那是你唯一的出路。在這期間，我會回到清醒世界，並將你要尋找卡達斯的事情告訴你的同伴。”它跳下桌面，信心滿滿地朝大門走去。“但我想他們的任務會更艱鉅……”"
