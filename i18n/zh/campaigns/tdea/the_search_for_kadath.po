You reflect on the black cat’s warning about danger in the waking world, and you wonder about the others who have followed Virgil Gray down the steps of slumber and through the Enchanted Woods. Are they here now, too? Perhaps if you find this castle and return with proof of the Dreamlands, you can save everyone: yourself, your friends, and the other dreamers as well."

"When day breaks and light peeks through the curtains of your room, you notice a cat-shaped silhouette sitting in front of the window. As your vision adjusts, you are transfixed by its piercing yellow eyes, bright as the dawn light. You recognize the shape as Virgil’s talking cat. You ask the black cat how long it has been sitting there.\n"
"“Long enough to know you are neither waking nor asleep,” it replies paradoxically.\n"
"The nature of this world still confounds you. Can one even sleep in the Dreamlands? If so, where would their minds go? Curious, you pose this question to the cat.\n"
"“Those here in their physical bodies can, but you are something else entirely. Now, never mind all that. On to business.” The black cat leaps onto your bed. “I gave your friends the warning you wanted me to pass along. They are preparing to enter the Dreamlands as well, it seems. In the meantime, I will stay with you. Somebody has to watch over you and my pet human, anyway.”"

"In the morning, you find Virgil and Randolph talking in the town square outside of Einar’s Place. You still aren’t quite sure what to think of either of them, but you have a good sense of where you should go next. After all, this is not your first excursion into the fabled land of dreams. Addressing Randolph, you suggest talking to the high priest Atal in the nearby Temple of the Elder Ones. It is a name you heard the last time you visited the city of Ulthar in your sleep, though until now you had no reason to seek the priest’s advice. Randolph gives you a startled glance that transforms quickly into a smirk.\n"
"“How curious,” he says, “I was about to suggest the same. Atal is wise beyond all our measure. He may know where to find the place we seek.”\n"

You resist the urge to turn up your nose and count yourself lucky you are on this cat’s good side. “Go on in,” he says, then licks his chops as he prepares to finish his meal."
msgstr "你告訴老貓，你到這只想跟阿塔爾談談，並沒有任何惡意。“啊，別擔心，人類。”貓打著哈欠說道——這個動作只有貓才能做到，並且這麼做的時候依然看起來十分高貴。“你看起來不像是會惹麻煩的類型。況且，這裡還有我鎮守呢。”你看到貓的面前有一小塊東西，那是被吃了一半的血淋淋的野雞。你強忍著露出厭惡表情的衝動，慶幸自己與這隻貓處好了關係，“進去吧。”它說完舔舔嘴巴，準備吃完這頓美餐。"

msgid "Resigned, you leave the temple on the hilltop behind. “I suppose we shall have to make do without Atal’s wisdom,” Randolph says with a sigh. “In any event, it is likely our destination is far from here—perhaps on another continent altogether.

msgid "You inform the cat you are entering the temple one way or another, and that a simple cat will not stand in your way. “Wanna bet?” he growls, lowering his body and preparing to pounce. Noticing the commotion, several cats guarding the temple surround you. You don’t wish to harm these cats, but you won’t let them block you from your objective, either. Nodding to your companions, you make a mad dash for the temple gates. A storm of hisses and angry screeches erupts all around you as the cats mount a desperate defense. A wall of tiny claws and teeth meets you, but you push through, defiant. You slam the stone door shut behind you and hear the old cat yelling from the other side: “Fine then, human! See your priest! But do not think this transgression will be forgiven!”"
msgstr "你告訴老貓，你無論如何都要進神廟，區區一隻貓攔不住你。“你想跟我打個賭嗎？”他咆哮道，伏下身子，準備猛撲。還有幾隻貓注意到這一幕，包圍了你。你不想傷害這些貓，但你也不會讓它們阻攔你。你向同伴點點頭，然後迅速衝向神廟大門。你的四面八方爆發出如同狂風般的一陣咆哮聲和憤怒的尖叫聲，貓群不顧一切地阻攔你。無數的小爪子和尖牙在面前阻攔著你，但你無所畏懼地強行穿過。你砰地一聲關上身後的石門，聽見老貓在門的另一邊大叫：“好啊，人類！見你的牧師去吧！但你別以為剛才你犯的罪行能得到寬恕！”"

"At the top of the temple, seated on an ivory dais, the high priest Atal awaits you. He is a frail, wiry man with a long, wispy black beard, caved-in cheeks, and the pale, milky eyes of one afflicted by blindness. “Do not let your eyes deceive you,” Randolph whispers as you seat yourselves in front of the dais. “Atal is over three centuries old, but his memory is sharp as a tack.”\n"
"You ask the priest about your quest and about your destination: the castle Randolph described from his dreams. “You speak of the resting place of the Great Ones, high above unknown Kadath. Even I know not its true location. And that is all well and good, for the fruits of attempting to ascend to such a place would be bitter indeed. My companion Barzai once scaled a peak only a fraction as sacred, and he was never seen nor heard from again. The gods of Kadath may seem powerless, but they are protected by the Other Gods from the Outside, whom it is better not to discuss. It would be wiser to let all the gods alone and leave this folly behind.”\n"
"Atal’s use of the word “gods” has you curious. You wonder aloud what kind of god might exist in a place like this.\n"
"The priest shakes his head. “They are not our gods, but the gods of Earth, for this land is but a reflection of yours.”\n"
"You attempt to pry deeper into Atal’s wisdom with your questioning, but his advice does not budge. “I have already said more than I should,” he insists. “Please, for your sake, pursue this madness no further.”"

"你向牧師詢問關於你們的任務和目的地：倫道夫所說的他夢中的那座城堡，“你所說的是夢境諸神的歇息地，就在未知的卡達斯上方高空。即便是我，也不知道它確切的位置。不知道也好，因為試圖到那個地方去的後果會很痛苦。我的同伴巴爾塞曾經登上一座有些神聖的山峰，從此渺無音訊。卡達斯的神明看似沒有任何力量，但它們受外神保護，而最好不要議論外神。不去管那些神明，不去管這件蠢事比較好。”\n"

He tells of an image carved into the face of the mountain Ngranek on the isle of Oriab—the likeness of the gods, or so he claims. He tells of the pillars of Kadatheron wherein the history of Earth’s Dreamlands is recorded. He tells of those slain by the hordes of Night itself and interred in the crypts of Zulan-Thek, the city of the dead. He tells of a baleful star above a forgotten city that appears on no map. “If you absolutely must seek Kadath in the Cold Wastes,” he says drowsily, “there is a city along the coast to the south: Dylath-Leen.

"You have ventured far and wide, from the quaint cobbled villages of the kingdom of the Skai to wondrous lands you could have never in a hundred years imagined. You learned much of the Dreamlands and of the gods who dwell atop unknown Kadath. Though you are closer to your goal, you still don’t know its precise location. In the meantime, your quest grows deadlier with each passing day. No matter where you go, foul, nightmarish creatures pursue you across land and sea. Winged beasts with no faces, horned Corsairs wielding razor-sharp cutlasses and commanding great black galleys—the agents of your demise bear many shapes. You decide to return to your ship, safe from the many dangers of the Dreamlands…or so you thought. Unfortunately, your ship is no safe haven. When you return, the crew and captain are nowhere to be found. There are no signs of struggle, but Virgil, who returned to the ship earlier to prepare for your next departure, is also missing.\n"
"“I fear the worst,” Randolph mourns. “If those fiendish Corsairs captured them, they are in dire trouble. They are agents of the Other Gods from the Outside, whose soul and messenger is the crawling chaos <smallcaps>Nyarlathotep</smallcaps>.” The mere utterance of the name causes you to shudder, though you do not know why. You ask where they might have been taken. As if discussing any other port of call, he replies: “The beasts who command their black galleys sail from the Moon. If we are to rescue Virgil and our other companions, that is where we must go.”"

"你的冒險已經來到了非常遙遠的地方，從斯凱王國古雅的鵝卵石村莊，到你畢生也無法想象的驚奇大陸。你知道了關於幻夢境的許多信息，以及居住在未知的卡達斯上方的神明。儘管你接近了自己的目標，但你依然不知道它具體的位置。與此同時，你的冒險之旅每過一天，都變得更加危險。無論你去到哪裡，令人作嘔的噩夢般的生物都在追著你，跨越山海。長有翅膀的無面野獸追獵著你，還有揮舞著鋒利短劍的長角海盜，開著巨大的黑色海盜船在海上緊追著你——你的死神真是千變萬化。你決定回到自己的船上，躲避幻夢境的危機……至少你是這麼想的。但很遺憾，你的船上並不安全。你回到船上時，船員和船長已不見蹤影。現場沒有掙扎的痕跡，但較早回到船上為下次航程做準備的維吉爾也不見了。\n"
"“恐怕他們已經……”倫道夫為他們哀悼，“如果那些邪惡的海盜抓了他們，那他們凶多吉少。那些海盗是外神的使徒，其真身與信使是蠕行混沌——<b>奈亞拉托提普</b>。”你一聽到這個名字就莫名地發抖。你問他們可能會被帶到什麼地方去。他就像討論尋常海港一樣回答你：“那群海盜的海船是從月球啟航的。如果我們想救回維吉爾和其他同伴，那我們必須到那兒去。”"

msgid "As you examine your surroundings, you notice that your other companions, including Virgil and Randolph, have been captured as well. They are unconscious at the moment, but maybe when they awaken you can formulate a plan to free yourselves. After all, despite this setback, you have learned much of the Dreamlands and of the gods who dwell atop unknown Kadath. Though you still don’t know its precise location, if you are able to escape from this wretched galley, perhaps there is hope for your quest. You swallow a ball of despair and hope that this is not the end of your journey…"
