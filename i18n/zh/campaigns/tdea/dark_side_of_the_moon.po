"Over the next few days, you learn more about your captors, but nothing about the black galley’s destination. It seems the Corsairs who hunted you down and captured you were only agents—or perhaps slaves—of a much greater evil: a race of greyish-white toad-like creatures with no eyes and slippery skin concealed beneath a loose disguise of silken clothing. You notice the creatures tend to stay below deck, and none of them deign to interact with you at all. Despite their disguises, the mere sight of one makes you retch. If they are indeed the masters of the Corsairs, this cannot bode well for you. You are kept apart from Virgil, and suspect he is on a different ship entirely.\n"
"More days pass. You have no way of telling how long it’s been since your capture. You have been kept well fed—that is, if being forced to eat bitter porridge from a dirty clay bowl counts as “well fed.” What concerns you most is the ship itself. Though you are sure it’s still moving, you no longer feel it rock back and forth as the waves push it from side to side, nor do you hear the sounds of the ocean or of gulls cawing over the coast. In fact, you hear very little at all now: only the occasional commands of one of the beasts from below deck, and the shouting of Corsairs in reply. No churning sea. No wind in the sails. Nothing at all.\n"
"Panic seizes your mind. What if you are destined for some strange port from which there can be no return? Could they have have sailed off the face of the planet itself? You have to do something. Escape, somehow. You try desperately to come up with a plan of action, but in vain. Corsairs relentlessly patrol the brig, and even if you managed to slip your bonds and sneak past them, where would you go?\n"
"Just as you begin to lose hope, a familiar face descends from the top deck. It is the ship captain you hired in Dylath-Leen: a chubby, middleaged fellow with a bushy beard and long hair pulled into a bun atop his head. He peeks around, realizes he is alone with you, and runs to your side. “I am so sorry, my friends,” he stammers quietly. “I had no idea who I was dealing with. I was tricked, I swear. I did not know that they were…I did not know…” he trails off, red-faced with guilt. You aren’t entirely sure what he means, but obviously he had something to do with your capture. Regardless, he is your only chance at escape. You tell him all will be forgiven if he helps you. He ponders for a moment, looks around, then finally nods and slices through your bonds with a curved knife.\n"
"Freedom has never tasted so sweet. You stretch your aching muscles and search nearby for your belongings, but there is little time to waste. Keeping a lookout, your rescuer whispers, “There may be a rowboat you can use on the top deck, but we’ll have to be quiet as mice. If they spot—” his voice suddenly catches in his throat, along with a sharp, jagged blade. He makes a dreadful gurgle as blood wells in his mouth, and he collapses. Behind him, a Corsair flashes a sadistic grin at his next victims: you."

"在過去的幾天裡，你對那群把你抓來的海盜有了進一步的瞭解，但你對這艘黑船的目的地仍然一無所知。似乎那群海盜只是奉命行事——或者說是執行主人命令的奴隸——它們背後有著更為邪惡的勢力：灰白色、貌似蟾蜍的一種生物，它們沒有眼睛，身上罩著一件寬鬆的絲質衣服來掩飾自己的皮膚。你注意到，它們更喜歡待在甲板下層內，並且絲毫不屑於與你接觸。儘管它們作了偽裝，但你光是看到它們，就感到一陣反胃。如果它們是海盜的主人，你接下來可能要遭殃了。你與維吉爾沒被關在一處，你懷疑他被關在了另一艘船上。\n"
"又過了幾天。你無法判斷被俘後究竟過了多久。你每頓都有飯吃——如果說髒碗裡發苦的糊狀物也算“飯”的話。最讓你在意的是這艘船本身。雖然你確定它仍在行駛，但你已無法感覺到海浪推動它向前時的前後晃動，也聽不到海浪聲和岸上的海鷗鳴叫聲。實際上，你現在幾乎聽不到什麼聲音：只能聽到甲板下層的野獸偶爾發號施令，以及海盜們回應命令的喊叫聲。海面沒有漣漪。船帆沒有絲毫被風吹動。什麼都沒有。\n"
"恐慌侵佔了你的意識。要是你被帶到一個陌生的港口，再也回不來了怎麼辦？它們是不是已經飛離了這顆星球表面？你不能坐以待斃。得設法逃出這裡。你絞盡腦汁想著逃跑計劃，但完全想不出來。海盜們不停地在禁閉室裡巡邏，即使你解開了束縛，從它們的看守下溜走，你該去哪呢？\n"
"就在你快要失去最後一絲希望的時候，從甲板上層下來一人，是你熟悉的面孔。正是你在狄拉斯-利恩僱的船長：一個胖胖的中年男子，長著一把濃密的鬍子，長長的頭髮在腦後梳成一個圓髻。他四處張望，發現這時只有你們二人，便跑到你旁邊。“我很抱歉，朋友。”他結結巴巴地低聲說，“我有眼不識泰山。我跟你發誓，我是被騙了。我當時不知道它們是……我不知道……”他說完，滿臉因羞愧而變得通紅。你並不清楚他說的是什麼意思，但很顯然，你們被俘一事跟他脫不了干係。無論如何，只有利用他才有機會逃出這裡。你說，如果他幫你逃跑，你會原諒他所作的一切。他想了一會，看看周圍，最後點點頭，用彎刀割斷了綁在你身上的繩子。\n"
"你從未感到自由的滋味竟是如此的甜美。你伸展痠痛的肌肉，在周圍尋找你的行李，但時間緊迫。船長一邊給你盯梢，一邊低聲說：“或許你可以用上層甲板的那條小艇，但我們得像老鼠一樣輕手輕腳。要是被它們發現——”他的話音戛然而止，一把帶有鋸齒的尖刀卡在了他的喉嚨。他發出了一道可怕的咯咯聲，同時口中鮮血湧出，隨後便倒下了。一名海盜站在他後面，獰笑著看著下一個受害者——你。"

"You have little choice if you are to save the Corsairs’ captives: You must sail to the Moon and rescue them yourself, or they will surely become slaves of the beasts who call it home. “They are evil creatures who serve an even greater evil,” Randolph explains as you prepare to set sail. “There are port cities like Dylath-Leen that have dealt with them before, but few know their true identity, for they wear disguises to mask their hideous nature.”\n"
"Perhaps your captain, who shuttled you to and from the various regions of the Dreamlands, dealt with them in the past. Or perhaps not. For the sake of your own sanity, it may be better not to dwell on suspicions of betrayal.\n"
"“How does one even sail to the Moon?” you ask, befuddled. By now, you are no stranger to the oddities of the Dreamlands, having spent weeks exploring its cities, wilds, and places stranger still. Even knowing the laws of physics and astronomy should not apply here, you struggle to imagine how one might sail a ship into space.\n"
"“It will be a long journey,” Randolph answers. “Far across the sea lie the Basalt Pillars of the West. Between these pillars, the ocean plunges off the edge of the world. If we sail off of the precipice between them, we can cross the void of space itself.”\n"
"You shouldn’t be surprised that the world of Earth’s Dreamlands is flat; after all, everything else here is a fiction, too. Still, you are incredulous. “I have sailed this route before,” Randolph says, sensing your skepticism. “But I fear this time it might be a one-way trip, especially without a crew. We may need to find an altogether different way to unknown Kadath. Are you prepared?”\n"
"You look to the horizon, where the cerulean sea meets the sky. Somewhere out there, your aid is needed. What’s more, the proof you seek may lie across the sea—over the edge of the very world itself. You prepare to embark."

"如果你想救出被這些海盜抓走的人們，你幾乎沒有其他選擇：你必須自行航行到被那群野獸稱為家園的月球，救出受害者，不然他們只會淪為野獸的奴隸。“它們是邪惡的怪物，聽命於它們更為邪惡的主人。”在你準備啟航時，倫道夫解釋說，“像狄拉斯-利恩那樣的港口城市就曾有人和它們打過交道，但因為它們靠著偽裝來掩飾自己的醜惡本性，鮮少有人知道它們的真實身份。\n"
"或許載你往返幻夢境中不同區域的船長，過去就曾跟它們有來往。也可能沒有。為了不讓自己受到打擊，還是不要糾結他是不是叛徒這件事為好。\n"
"“怎麼才能飛到月亮上去？”你疑惑地問道。現在的你對幻夢境的怪事已經不再陌生，你曾花了好幾個星期來探索幻夢境裡的城市和荒野，以及一些至今仍感到奇怪的地方。就算知道物理學和天文學的定律在這裡並不適用，你還是無法想象怎麼把一艘船開到太空裡去。\n"
"“要走很遠的路。”倫道夫回答，“在大海那邊，遠遠地坐落著西境玄武岩柱。在那些柱子之間，海水會從世界的邊緣傾注而下。如果我們航行穿過那些柱子中央，就能穿越虛空本身。”\n"
"你不該對幻夢境的世界是平的感到驚奇；畢竟，這裡的一切都是虛幻。但你仍然無法相信。“我曾經這麼走過。”倫道夫察覺到你的懷疑，繼續說道，“但這一次連一個船員都沒有，我擔心會有去無回。我們或許得另尋一條迥異的路來去往未知的卡達斯。你準備好了嗎？”\n"
"你望向地平線，蔚藍的海洋在那裡與天空相接。越過那裡，就能找到需要你幫助的人。而且，你要尋找的證據，或許就在大海的另一邊——這個世界的邊緣以外。你準備好出發了。"

"Despite your best efforts, your pursuers are too many for you to escape unnoticed. You are cornered and taken captive. Virgil tries his best to resist, but Randolph gives in, knowing that his resistance is futile. You are brought into a large domed temple on the dark side of the Moon and forced to kneel before one of the moon-beasts. It is dressed in grey robes and heavy wrappings, but you see its true visage beneath: its slippery, clammy flesh and its drooling, bulbous lips. “Wonderful,” it praises its henchmen. “Our master will be pleased.” Behind you, Corsairs prevent your escape, while a row of winged things on either side of you squawk rhythmically and flap their wings. A preparation, you suspect, for an unpleasant journey.\n"
"The moon-beast orders its slaves to haul you onto the winged creatures. “Bring these wretches to the sacrificial pits,” it decrees. “They must be judged for their heresy. The moon lizard shall feed well tonight.”\n"
"“What? No, this isn’t right.” Randolph grits his teeth.\n"
"There is a bright flash of light, and you <i>awaken</i>. You are sitting atop a comfortless and unfamiliar bed. A wave of relief washes over you at first. Have you finally awoken from this endless dream? Then the still, cold void embraces you, and you realize where you truly are. Instead of four walls and a ceiling, you are surrounded by a bright, starry cosmos. Galaxies and nebulae in the distance seem to stare back at you with unfeeling cruelty. Your bed floats along the thinnest of silver threads. Virgil’s cat sits up at your feet. “You’re not awake,” the black cat says. “Not yet.”\n"
"Another flash of light. The moon-beast orders its slaves to haul you onto the winged creatures. “Bring these wretches to the High Priest in the Cold Wastes,” it decrees. “They must be judged for their heresy.”\n"
"“Worry not, my friends,” Randolph whispers to you. “Did you hear that? The Cold Wastes is the region wherein unknown Kadath lies. With any luck, they will bring us right to our destination—” Randolph is cut off as the moon-beast grabs him and pulls him to his feet.\n"
"“No, not you. I know of you. You will be a gift. Fodder for the moon lizard. Come.” It drags Randolph away before your very eyes. His screams echo off the walls of the temple and fade as he is hauled underground. Then, borne aloft on dreadful, membranous wings, your mounts carry you into the void of space."

"儘管使盡了渾身解數，你依然無法躲過眾多追兵的眼睛。它們把你逼到絕路，抓住了你。維吉爾奮力抵抗，而心知抵抗只是徒勞的倫道夫卻已放棄掙扎。它們把你們帶到了月球暗面的一座帶有穹頂的巨大神廟，強迫你們在一頭月獸面前跪下。那月獸身著灰袍，重重包裹著自己的身軀，但你從兜帽下看到了它真實的面容：它那溼滑的皮膚和那淌著口水的、外凸的嘴脣。“好極了。”它誇讚自己的手下，“我們的主人會很滿意的。”許多海盜站在你們身後，防止你們逃跑，而站在你們兩側的怪物拍打著翅膀，發出規律的尖聲嗥叫。你猜想這將是一趟不安旅程的前兆。\n"
"那頭月獸號令它的奴僕把你們拖到帶有翅膀的怪物身上。“把這些惡徒帶到祭坑去。”它說道，“他們必須為自己的異端身份遭受審判。月蜥今晚會得到一頓飽餐。”\n"
"“什麼？不，這樣不對。”倫道夫咬緊牙關說道。\n"
"一道亮光閃過，你甦醒了。你坐在一張舒適的陌生床鋪上。如釋重負的感覺立馬湧上了你的心頭。你終於從這場漫長的睡夢中醒來了嗎？隨後，寒冷而靜止的虛空包圍著你，你才意識到自己這是在哪。在你周圍的不是四面牆壁和天花板，而是繁星點綴的明亮宇宙。遠處的銀河與星雲像是在冷冷地回視著你的目光。你的床漂浮在一條再細不過的銀色絲線上。維吉爾的貓在你腳邊坐起身来。“你沒有醒來。”黑貓說道，“目前還沒。”\n"
"又一道閃光。那頭月獸號令它的奴僕把你們拖到帶有翅膀的怪物身上。“把這些惡徒帶到冰封荒土的高階祭司那裡去。”它說道，“他們必須為自己的異端身份遭受審判。”\n"
"“朋友們，別擔心。”倫道夫對你們低聲說，“你們聽到了嗎？冰封荒土就是卡達斯所在的地方。要是走運，它們能直接把我們帶到目的地去——”倫道夫話音未落就被月獸一把拉了下來。\n"
"“不，除了你。我知道你。你會被我們送給月蜥，作為一頓飽餐。來吧。”它在你們的眼前拉走了倫道夫。倫道夫的尖叫聲迴盪在神廟的每個房間，隨著他被帶到地下，聲音漸漸消失。然後，你們的坐騎扇動著可怕的膜狀翅膀，帶你們飛入了太空。"

"As the white galley glides silently back toward the Earth, its captain sings a soft, melodic shanty, which the ship’s oarsmen repeat. You seem to know the language well, despite having never heard it before. You ask after your course, but the bearded man does not reply other than to continue his harmonious song. You plead with him to aid you in your search for unknown Kadath, believing it to be of the utmost importance. “You should not seek to disturb the gods,” the man warns, his song interrupted. “They are far greater than you or I. Do you not see the folly in your ambition?” You beseech him once more, telling him you must bring back proof of the Dreamlands, and cannot return home without the aid of the gods. “Would that be so dire a fate? Look around you.”\n"
"You do as the captain requests, and are met with a scene of such serene beauty that it leaves you breathless. The seas below glitter in the moonlight like an ocean of diamonds. Along the horizon, you see crystalline coastlines, blissful countrysides, lush mountain vistas, and emerald-green gardens. The air is crisp and cool as you descend below the clouds. Your heart swells with the sweet fragrance of flowers from the nearby coast. Never in all your years in “reality” have you experienced a beauty so <i>real</i>.\n"
"Maybe staying wouldn’t be so bad. You’ve already spent weeks—no, months—in this land. There have been hardships, yes, but could you really return to your mundane reality after everything you’ve seen and experienced in this wondrous land?\n"
"Then, far to the north, you see it. Looming just over the horizon, or perhaps beyond the dreams of Earth itself. A white peak, atop which sits an azure beacon of refracted moonlight. The bearded man follows your gaze. “So be it,” he sighs. He changes course, following now behind a celestial bird whose plumage matches the vibrant sky. “We sail to the abode of the gods themselves.”"

"然後，在遙遠的北方，你隱約在地平線上方看到了一座白色的山峰，峰頂坐落著一座折射著月光的蔚藍燈塔。或許此地在地球自身的夢境以外。大鬍子船長朝你視線方向看去。“好吧。”他嘆氣道。他改變了路線，跟在一隻飛翔的鳥兒身後，它的羽翼與藍天十分相稱。“我們會開往神明的居所。”"
