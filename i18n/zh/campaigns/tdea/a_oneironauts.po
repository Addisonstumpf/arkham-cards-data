"You open your eyes to the sound of a cat’s shrill caterwauling. You had been drifting off to…well, not sleep, exactly. Despite—or perhaps due to—your dreaming, you have been unable to truly sleep in this realm. When you come to your senses, you spot the source of the wailing: Virgil’s cat, black as the void of space itself, sits several feet away waiting for you to pay attention. “Finally,” it declares, “about time you noticed something outside your own head. Listen, I got something important to tell you.”"

"<i>接著冒險2-A，入夢者朝未知的領域航行……</i>\n"
"你突然聽到貓尖銳的嚎叫聲，睜開了眼睛。本來你已經睡著了……但準確來說，不是睡著。儘管——或者說正是因為——你在做夢，你無法在這個世界真正地睡著。當你回過神來，你注意到那聲嚎叫的來源：維吉爾的貓，像虛空之地一般黑，它正坐在幾英尺外，等著你注意到它。“終於看過來了。”它說，“你也是時候從自己腦袋裡醒來，注意一下外界了。聽著，我有很重要的事要對你說。”"

msgid "If at least one investigator was not captured:"
msgstr "如果至少有一位調查員未被俘："

"“Wait, where is my human?” the cat asks, craning its head to look around the deck of your ship. “Didn’t I leave him with you?”\n"
"You explain that Virgil has been taken captive by Corsairs, and the cat replies by licking its paw without much concern. “Oh yeah, that’s right. Okay. I’m on the same page as you now.”"

"“等等，我的人類在哪？”黑貓伸長了脖頸環顧你的甲板，問道，“我不是讓他跟你在一起嗎？”\n"
"你把維吉爾被海盜抓走的事情告訴了它，但它聽完只是毫不在意地舔舔自己的爪子。“噢，好吧，沒關係。我跟你想的一樣。”"

msgid "If all of the investigators were captured:"
msgstr "如果所有調查員皆已被俘："

msgid "You try to shush the black cat, but it ignores you. “Relax. Your captors are all up on deck at the moment.” You ask bitterly why the creature is so cavalier about your capture, and request that it free you. “Nah. Somebody else has that covered, if memory serves,” it replies enigmatically."
msgstr "你示意黑貓安靜，但它無視了你：“別緊張。現在那群海盜都在甲板上呢。”你咬牙切齒地問它為什麼對你們被俘一事毫不在乎，要求它放了你。“不。如果沒記錯的話，會有別人來幹這事。”它神秘兮兮地說道。"

msgstr "如果《睡夢之網》(劇本B)的調查員詢問是否<i>黑貓調查真相</i>，告訴他們沒有。"

msgid "The black cat sees Randolph at the helm of your ship and glares at him suspiciously. You wonder aloud what is wrong. “Normally I like the smell of fish, but this is too fishy. Something is wrong. There are not supposed to be two of him. But my memory is fuzzy…” You thought you were confused before, but now you are truly lost. Two Randolphs? “Yes,” the black cat affirms. “This one, and another in the waking world. That seems off,” the black cat understates the problem. “I think something is trying to interfere. I need to go figure this out.” With that, the cat leaps out of view."
msgstr "黑貓看到倫道夫在你的船上掌舵，懷疑地盯著他。你開口問它有什麼不對勁的。“一般來說，我喜歡魚的味道，但這條魚太腥了。有點不對勁。不可能有兩個他。但我的記憶也變得模糊……”你之前只是有點聽不懂它說的話，但這回你是徹底摸不著頭腦了。兩個倫道夫？“嗯。”黑貓肯定地答道，“這邊有一個，清醒世界還有另一個。這很不對勁啊。”黑貓輕描淡寫地說道，“我想有人正試圖干預。我得查清這事。”說完，黑貓就跳出了你的視野。"

msgid "Skip the rest of this interlude. In both Campaign Logs, record <i>the black cat is searching for the truth</i>."
msgstr "跳過本幕間故事的餘下部分。在兩份冒險日誌中，記錄<i>黑貓調查真相</i>。"

msgstr "黑貓告知了地下世界的事情。"

msgid "“Your friends are in a bit of trouble. They took a one-way trip to a pretty awful place, and I don’t know if they’ll be able to navigate it without me. I know your quest is looking pretty dire right now, too, but if I don’t stick by them, it won’t matter whether you reach Kadath or not. Good luck. Try not to die.” With that, the black cat leaps out of view."
msgstr "“你的朋友們遇上了點麻煩。他們踏上了一場有去無回的旅行，到一個十分可怕的地方去，但我不知道沒了我他們還能不能到達那裡。我知道你現在的任務也很艱鉅，但如果我不跟在他們身邊，就算你到了卡達斯也沒有任何意義。祝你好運。別把命給丟了。”說完，黑貓就跳出了你的視野。"

msgid "“Your friends are doing about as well as can be expected, really. But they’re worried about you, and for good reason, it seems. They might not be able to reach you any time soon. They want me to help you out instead, so I’ll be staying here for a little while longer. Gotta make sure you survive. If you don’t, well…” it takes a long pause, “…let’s not talk about that.”"
msgstr "“你的朋友們做得就像預期的一樣好，真的。但他們很擔心你，也很難怪他們會這樣，畢竟他們可能短時間內無法來幫你。他們想讓我代替他們，幫你走出困境，所以我會在這裡再待一段時間。我會保護你周全。如果你遭逢不測，唔……”它停頓了很久，“……還是別說這些了。”"

msgid "The black cat tells you all about the region of the Dreamlands your companions have entered. “The entire surface of the Dreamlands, where you’ve been exploring, covers the Underworld like a beautiful silk dress over decayed skin. You have no reason to go there, which is a good thing, because it is a particularly inhospitable place. You actually might have walked right by one entrance to the Underworld, now that I think about it—back in the Enchanted Woods. There are several other entrances as well: beneath an old monastery in Leng, another in the ruins of Sarkomand…”"
msgstr "黑貓告訴你關於你的同伴們進入的幻夢境的一切：“你們一直在探索的幻夢境，就覆蓋在地下世界之上，就像一件美麗的絲綢裙子覆蓋著腐爛的皮膚。你不用到那裡去，這是好事，因為那裡尤其不歡迎來客。我想起來，實際上，你或許曾經路過通向地下世界的入口——就在魔幻森林。除此之外，還有幾個入口：一個在冷原隱修院下方，另一個在薩爾科曼德的廢墟……”"
