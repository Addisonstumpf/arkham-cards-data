"The scenery continues for mile after mile until at last you find an anomaly.  Some distance up the beach from a saltwater pool and near the edge of a dense forest sit the remains of a quaint cottage.  It looks like a disaster photograph, with the thatch roof exploding upward and the wooden walls splintering out, but with each piece suspended in air.  You approach the house cautiously, and as you circle the building, you see the White Rabbit - the same one that traversed Arkham not long ago!  The rabbit wails anxiously to two other figures that regard him sadly -  a man and a lizard.  \"My house, my poor house!  Oh the monster that must have done this!\"\n"
"The dirt-caked man shakes his head forlornly and strokes his chin as he surveys the damage.  \"And a monster that didn't even finish what it started, your honor!  It didn't think to let the pieces fall before it vanished away!\"\n"
"\"Never you mind the pieces, Pat!\" the White Rabbit snaps, \"Call someone to put it back together!  Oh, how late I shall be…\"\n"
"You take a half step forward, only for the grinning head of the Cheshire Cat to wink into existence before you.  \"The poor rabbit, not a roof over his head to speak of.\"  The cat's paw appears and gestures toward the shattered house.  \"As Gurathnaka claws at your world with its front, its back nails gouge into Wonderland.  The shadows crept at the corners until now, only seen by those who also lurk in the dark, solitary as oysters.\"  Its eyes glance in the direction of the beach and vanish, leaving only its smile to linger a few moments after.  You have only a few seconds to consider the cat's words.\n"
"\"You there!\"  You look down from the suspended grin to see the White Rabbit looking up at you haughtily.  \"Standing with idle hands when there's a monster about!  Come come, help Bill to find this beast and drag it back! It has much to answer for!\"  His finger points to the lizard who tips his cap back at you hesitantly.\n"
"Before you can reply in any fashion, the White Rabbit turns back to the cottage and resumes his despairing.  You rub the back of your neck, at a loss for words as you weigh your options.  Forced into work as you are, there's a chance you might learn something by venturing out into the surf."

"風景一成不變，持續了好幾英里，直到你終於發現有異。在距離一個鹹水池的沙灘往上稍遠的地方，靠近一座茂密森林的邊緣，有一個典雅精緻小屋的殘骸。它看起來像一張災難照片，茅草屋頂向上炸開，木牆四分五裂，但每塊殘骸都浮在空中。你小心翼翼地靠近那間屋子，當你繞著小屋查看時，你看到了白兔，就是不久前穿過阿卡姆的那隻！另外兩個身影——一個男人和一隻蜥蜴——悲傷地看著白兔，而白兔對著他們焦慮地大哭。“我的房子，我可憐的房子！哦，做出這種事的一定是個怪物！”\n"
"滿身泥土的男人可憐兮兮地搖搖頭，一邊摸著下巴，一邊檢視著損害。 “而且還是個有始無終的怪物，大人！在牠消失之前甚至沒有讓碎片掉下來！”\n"
"“別管那些碎片，帕特！”白兔厲聲道，“叫人把它重新組裝起來！哦，我不知道要遲到多久了……”\n"
"你只向前走了半步，柴郡貓咧著嘴笑的腦袋就眨著眼出現在你面前。“可憐的白兔，他可沒法遮風避雨了。”貓的爪子出現了，朝著破碎的房子指了指。“當古拉斯納卡正面朝著你的世界伸出爪子時，牠後腿的尖爪則刺進了仙境。暗影原本潛伏在角落裡，直到現在。只有那些同樣潛伏在黑暗中的才能看得見，像牡蠣般孑然。”牠的眼睛朝海灘的方向瞥了一眼，然後就消失了，只剩下牠的微笑多停留了片刻。你只有幾秒鐘的時間來思考貓的話。\n"
"“那邊的，你！”你將目光從掛在空中的咧笑往下移，看到白兔盛氣凌人地抬頭看著你。“有怪物出沒，豈能置身事外！來來來，幫比爾找到這頭野獸，把牠拖回來！牠有很多該負責的事！”他的手指指向蜥蜴，蜥蜴遲疑地向你脫帽致意。\n"
"在你能作任何回答之前，白兔就轉身回到小屋，繼續陷入絕望。你揉揉後腦杓，不發一語，衡量著你的選擇。像現在這樣被迫做事，也許進入海浪冒險之後，你有機會能發現什麼。"

"Darkness eats away at the beach behind you as you escape the calamity.  The White Rabbit watches anxiously towards the commotion, and begins to panic as the darkness sweeps inland. \"The monster has returned!\" he shrieks, taking terrified backward steps, \"Not my house, anything but that!\"  He scrambles through the cottage door and shuts it tight before you can dissuade him.  You try to reason with the rabbit, hoping to bring him to his senses, but he remains locked inside in quiet terror.  As the shadows advance, you have no choice but to turn and flee.  You look back over your shoulder to see the White Rabbit's house vanish into the advancing darkness with the crunch and shudder of timbers.\n"
"Gradually, the flowing shadows creep to a halt, and like a riptide sweep back out to sea at the same speed that they consumed inward.  Wherever the darkness recedes, the landscape it leaves behind is warped and cracked.  You retrace your steps hesitantly, returning to the ground where the White Rabbit's house once stood.  Only scratched stone from the foundation remains, with no trace of the rabbit to speak of.  You can only speculate why the shadows lashed out as they did.  Perhaps your presence drove them ravenous for the taste of the real world, or perhaps they are merely running wild as their master occupies itself with Arkham."

"當你逃離災難時，黑暗吞噬了你身後的海灘。白兔焦慮地看著這場騷動，當黑暗開始席捲內陸時，他陷入了恐慌。“怪物回來了！”他尖叫著，驚恐地連連後退，“不，放過我的房子！”在你能勸阻他之前，他就爬進房子的門，把門關得緊緊的。你試圖勸說這隻兔子，希望能讓他恢復理智，但他仍然在一片寂靜的恐懼中把自己鎖在裡面。隨著暗影的逼進，你別無選擇，只能轉身逃跑。你回頭望去，只見隨著木頭的嘎吱聲和顫動，白兔的房子消失在不斷擴張的黑暗之中。\n"
"流動的影子慢慢地逐漸停了下來，然後以它們侵蝕內陸時同樣的速度，像激流般卷回大海。黑暗退去的地方，無論哪裡，留下的都是扭曲、破裂的地貌。你猶豫地回到了曾經是白兔家的地方。那裡只剩下地基的石頭，滿是劃痕，沒有半點兔子的踪跡。你只能推測為什麼暗影會作出這樣的猛烈攻擊。也許是你的出現，讓它們渴求現實世界的滋味，或者，也許它們只是趁著主人在阿卡姆忙碌著時到處撒野。"

"The dark creature's destruction sends out a force like the opposite of a shockwave.  A wall of stillness sweeps outward from the remains, and for a minute you can hear the blood rushing in your ears as the shadows evaporate before you.  The swell of the sea returns slowly, and the taste of the salt air rouses your senses.  The beach behind you seems brighter and warmer than before, and you take exhausted steps back inland.\n"
"Further back, amid the sedge grass and small dunes, you find the Walrus and the Carpenter lying in wretched states.  The sand around them is stained with darkness, and the last driplets of shadow leak from the corners of their mouths as they lie groaning.  \"A rotten bunch… it's shellfish poisoning, I'll wager…\" the Carpenter mumbles as he clutches his stomach.  The Walrus can only grunt painfully in agreement as it rolls to one side.  After everything this pair did to the oysters, and you besides, you must decide what to do with them."

"黑暗生物的毀滅發出一道力場，像相反的衝擊波一般。一道寂靜的牆從黑暗生物的殘骸向外擴散，當黑影在你面前消散時，有那麼一分鐘，你可以聽到血液在你的耳朵裡流動的聲音。慢慢地，大海的波濤回來了，空氣裡的鹹味喚醒你的感官。你身後的海灘似乎比之前更明亮溫暖，你疲憊地向內陸走去。\n"
"再往後面，在莎草叢和小沙丘之間，你發現海象和木匠倒在地上，狀態很悲慘。他們躺著呻吟，四周的沙子沾染著暗影，而最後一滴的暗影正從他們的嘴角滲出。“一堆腐爛的……我敢打賭，是貝類中毒……”木匠捂著肚子咕噥著。海象只能一邊翻身，一邊痛苦地咕噥著表示同意。在這兩個傢伙對牡蠣和對你所做的一切之後，你必須決定如何處置他們。"

msgid "In spite of everything, the two gluttons are as much a part of Wonderland as the oysters are.  Everyone has to eat something, after all.  You take a small amount of time to help them recover from their possession.  The Walrus and the Carpenter give you no thanks, but they do comment on their experience of being overtaken by the shadows with rather embellished details."
msgstr "不管怎樣，這兩個貪吃的傢伙和牡蠣一樣都是仙境的一份子。每個人畢竟都必須吃東西。你花了一點時間來幫助他們，讓他們從被附身的狀態中恢復過來。海象和木匠沒有對你表示感謝，但他們鉅細靡遺地告訴了你他們被黑影控制時的經歷。"

msgid "Weakened as they may be, the greedy duo is responsible for plenty of destruction and death already, and might rampage again, given the chance.  You quickly and quietly dispatch the Walrus and the Carpenter, who offer no opposition whatsoever to their demise."
msgstr "儘管他們可能已經很虛弱了，但這兩個貪婪的傢伙仍必須對大量的破壞和死亡負責，如果再有下次，他們可能還是會肆意破壞。你迅速且安靜地送了海象和木匠上路，他們連表達反對的機會都沒有。"

"The sand transitions back to dirt as you return to the White Rabbit's house.  You find that the suspended fragments of his house have collapsed down, and the rabbit is now fussing over the mess.  \"Dear, dear, another mess!  Where is that workman?  He may as well have been another monster, for all the good he did!\"  The White Rabbit snorts in frustration and turns toward you.  \"And you!  Have you brought the monster with you?\"  You do your best to explain the ordeal, and the rabbit nods along with growing look of disturbance on his face.\n"
"As you end your tale, the White Rabbit jerks with a sudden twitch and grabs for his pocket watch.  \"No, no, I'm even more late now!  I must hurry!  Must find my gloves, or the Duchess will be furious!\"  He dashes towards the door, having completely dismissed you in his hurry.  You quickly try to question the rabbit further about Wonderland and the dangers ahead, but your words fall on deaf ears.  The rabbit is absorbed in his new task utterly and will not spare a moment for anything else.  You depart with a sigh, resigned to spend your precious time elsewhere.  However, between the oyster's advice and your triumph over the shadows here, you feel as though you are on the right path."

"當你回到白兔的房子時，沙子在轉變回土壤。你發現他家漂浮的碎片已經垮掉了，兔子正對這一片狼藉非常激動。“天啊，天啊，又是一團糟！那個工人跑去哪裡了？他可能也是另一頭怪物，看看他做了那麼多好事！”白兔沮喪地嗤了一聲，轉向你。“還有你！你把怪物帶來了嗎？”你盡力向他解釋了這場災難，兔子不斷點頭，臉上不安的表情越來越沉重。\n"
"當你講述完畢時，白兔突然抽搐了一下，然後抓住了他的懷錶。“不，不，我現在更遲到了！我得快點！必須找到我的手套，不然公爵夫人會大發雷霆的！”他衝向門口，匆匆忙忙地想把你打發走。你試圖快速地進一步詢問兔子關於仙境和未來的危險，但他對你的問題充耳不聞。兔子對於他的新任務全神貫注，不會為其他任何事情分心。你無可奈何地嘆了口氣離開這裡，節省你寶貴的時間。不論如何，有了牡蠣的建議和你戰勝黑影的經驗，你感覺自己似乎走在了正確的道路上。"
