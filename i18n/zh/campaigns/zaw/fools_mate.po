"The winding paths through the rolling hills remind you of Miskatonic Valley in a way.  You might feel at ease, were it not for the glimpses of strange creatures and wisps of shadows each time you look back over your shoulder.\n"
"Your worries are compounded as the landscape smooths out to tidy fields in perfect squares.  Immaculate hedge rows and canals line each plot of land.  The grass of each alternates between darker and lighter shades to contrast with its neighbors.  The parallel with a chess board occurs to you at the same moment that you catch sight of several enormous white chess pieces, alive as any person and grouped together fearfully.  The pieces regard your approach warily and hold themselves proudly until a distant creaking and cracking sends them back to shuddering timidly.\n"
"A massive storm of shadows looms several fields beyond your own, churning but stationary.  \"It is a travesty, is it not?\"  You turn to find the White King staring grimly at the fearsome event alongside you.  \"To think we once fought with such chivalry according to the Rules of Battle with the red army.\"  You press the king on his comments, and he realizes rather suddenly that you are not a native of Wonderland.\n"
"\"You are perhaps another visitor from Alice's domain?  You have impeccable timing.  Completely wrong, but impeccable.  My own army has lost its nerve completely, and I am in need of new pawns.  Strong and keen, brave and true.\"  The King looks to you and stares in uncomfortable silence with a disappointed look stamped on his face.  \"You will have to do.\"  You attempt to protest being drafted, but the White King snorts impudently.  \"Hush hush, it's an honor to serve a king, you know!  All you must do is travel to the eighth square and capture the Red King.  Defeat the Red Queen as well, if you are able.  You will of course meet with some opposition, but I'm confident - no, confident is the wrong word.  Optimistic?  Satisfied?  Yes, that will do - satisfied that you will find success.\"\n"
"Irritation builds within you at the White King's haughtiness, but you consider the situation carefully.  You entered Wonderland to seek out and destroy Gurathnaka's shadows, and such a target is now within your sight.  With any luck, you might even be able to convince some of the other white chess pieces to assist you in stamping out this corruption.  With some resignation, you accept the White King's badgering and proceed to the edge of his defenses.  The Cheshire Cat grins down at you from the battlements, lounging lazily but eyes fixed on the distant shadows permeating the far side of the chess board."

"蜿蜒曲折的小路穿過連綿起伏的丘陵，某方面讓你聯想到米斯卡塔尼克山谷。如果不是每次回頭時都能瞥見奇怪的生物和一縷縷暗影，你可能會更放鬆自在。\n"
"隨著景觀逐漸平緩，形成完美正方形的整齊田野，你的憂慮加深了。完美的一排排樹籬和運河形成每塊土地的界線。每個區域草叢的明暗度深淺交錯，與鄰近區域形成對比。當你意識到這就像是西洋棋盤的同時，你看到幾顆巨大的白色棋子，像人一樣活生生的，他們害怕地聚集在一起。這些棋子們驕傲地站著，警惕地看著你靠近，直到遠處的嘎吱聲和碎裂聲讓它們再次膽怯地顫抖。\n"
"一個巨大的暗影風暴籠罩著距離你的區域幾格以外的田野，風暴不斷翻攪但沒有移動。“這真諷刺，不是嗎？”你轉身發現白棋國王嚴肅地盯著你身後的可怕景象。“想想我們曾經以如此的騎士精神，按照戰鬥規則與紅棋軍隊作戰。”你向國王追問他的評論，他突然意識到你不是仙境的居民。\n"
"“你是另一位從愛麗絲的國度來的訪客？你來的時機無可挑剔。完全錯誤，但無可挑剔。我自己的軍隊已經完全失去了勇氣，我需要新的兵卒。強大而敏銳，勇敢而純粹。”國王看向你，在令人不安的沉默中盯著你，臉上帶著失望的表情。“你必須要去。”你試圖抗議被徵召入伍，但白棋國王粗魯地哼了一聲。“安靜，替國王服務是一種榮幸，你知道的！你要做的只有前往第八格，擄獲紅棋國王。如果可以，也把紅棋王后擊敗。當然，你會遇到一些阻力，但我有信心——不，信心不是正確的詞。樂觀？滿意？對，就是這個——我很滿意你會找到方法的。”\n"
"白棋國王的傲慢讓你感到惱火，但你仔細考慮了現況。你進入仙境尋找並摧毀古拉斯納卡的暗影，而這樣的目標現在就在你的眼前。運氣好的話，你甚至可以說服其他一些白棋子來幫助你拔除這些腐化。你半推半就地接受了白棋國王的糾纏，然後前往他防禦的前線。柴郡貓從城垛上對著你咧嘴一笑，懶洋洋地躺著，但眼睛卻盯著從棋盤遠處另一邊滲出的暗影。"

You take a moment to catch your breath, and have barely rested a moment when you hear a loud call nearby.  The White Knight approaches on his horse and promptly falls off, but just as quickly stands with a laugh.  \"Ah, what a glorious battle that was, young pawn!  Few are able to keep pace with a queen at all, but you have done so splendidly!  With skill such as yours, why, I dare say you have the makings of a fine knight within you!\"  The knight's lack of perspective is oddly refreshing amid the horrors being wreaked by the shadows, and you give him an appreciative nod."
msgstr "經過幾分鐘的拖延戰，頑強的紅棋王后倒在地上，再也無法繼續追擊你。你花了一點時間喘口氣，幾乎沒有休息到，就聽到附近響亮的叫喊聲。白棋騎士騎著馬接近，立即摔下來，但很快就笑著站了起來。“啊，多麼光榮的一戰啊，年輕的小卒！很少有人能跟得上女王的步伐，但你卻做得如此出色！以你這樣的技能，哎呀，我敢說你能成為一個優秀的騎士！”騎士糟糕的洞察力在這片暗影肆虐的恐怖之中奇妙地令人感到振奮，你向他感謝地點了點頭。"

As the crowd of red chess pieces closes in on you, the White Knight gallops onto the scene once more, and intervenes between you and the shadowy horde.  \"Carry on quickly, my friend,\" he bellows, \"and leave this rabble to me!\"  He charges clumsily at the advancing line in a show of hopeless heroics, but he has given you much-needed time to focus on your task.  You turn away from the carnage and work as quickly as you can."

"You abandon the prospect of victory against the Red King and flee the chess board fields.  The landscape tears as you flee, ripped apart by the sudden surge of shadows while the red pieces rush forward to finish the defenders.  It seems as if you may be overwhelmed as well, but the shifting landscape opens up a gap in the orderly hedge rows.  You dive through without hesitation and hunker down as the land around you shudders in destruction.\n"
"Minutes pass, and finally the wild din fades, replaced again by an eerie silence.  You emerge from the hedges to find the entire battlefield now marred and blasted by the dark surge.  Bodies of defeated chess pieces lie strewn about the fields, most of them cracked and contorted from whatever force ripped them apart.  You glance in the direction of the Red King's castle to see it as you first did: a red shard in a dark vortex.  Slowly you make your way back towards the ruined defenses of the White King to search for survivors.\n"
"Scattered stone and derelict pillars are all that remain of the white castle you first set out from.  Many of the missing chunks of masonry look as though they were bitten or clawed apart rather than shattered.  The trail of destruction leads directly to the throne of the White King.  You find his body on the steps to his throne, shredded to unrecognizable state but for the crown he once wore.  You realize now just how deeply the shadows have divided Wonderland.  The two sides may have once met in combat honorably, as the white pieces expected to fight, but Gurathnaka's corruption transformed the red pieces into remorseless monsters that share its hunger.  You depart solemnly to recuperate and find a new battlefield to face the shadows upon."

"你放棄了戰勝紅棋國王的希望，逃離了棋盤領域。當你逃離時，地形被突然湧現的暗影撕裂，同時紅色的棋子們衝上前去了結防守方。似乎你也將要被捲入其中，但不斷移動的地形在整齊的幾排樹籬中造成了一個缺口。你毫不猶豫地跳進去蹲著，四周的土地因毀滅而劇烈震動。\n"
"幾分鐘過去了，狂野的嘈雜聲終於消失了，取而代之的是詭異的寂靜。你從樹籬中出來，發現整個戰場都被黑暗浪潮破壞和炸毀了。被擊敗的棋子屍體散落在田野上，其中大部分都被某種力量撕裂而破裂、扭曲。你朝紅棋國王城堡的方向瞥了一眼，就像你初次看到的那樣：黑暗漩渦中的紅色碎片。你慢慢地回到白棋國王防線的廢墟，尋找倖存者。\n"
"你最初出發的白色城堡整個只剩下散落的石塊和破敗的柱子。許多缺失的石塊看起來像是被咬開或被爪子分開而不是破碎。毀壞的痕跡直接通往白棋國王的王座。你在通往王座的台階上發現他的屍體，除了他曾經戴過的王冠外，他的屍體被撕碎成無法辨認的狀態。在這一刻你意識到暗陰將仙境的分裂得多深。棋子雙方可能曾經光榮地在戰場上相遇，就如同白棋期望般的對決，但古拉斯納卡的腐蝕將紅棋變成了無情的怪物來分擔它的飢餓。你嚴肅地離開，療養休息，然後繼續尋找下一個面對暗影的新戰場。"

"You approach the fallen Red King cautiously.  The shadows have ceased to flow out of him, but you're not about to take extra risks if you can help it.  Moments pass without event, and gradually the sound of the Red King's labored breathing magnifies.  You turn him over and are astonished to find that despite his injuries, the king is asleep!  You open the Red King's eyes manually, only to find them filled with swirling darkness.  Whatever shadowy power has possessed the king is keeping him alive even in this state.  You ponder the possibilities and it soon becomes clear to you what has happened.  Gurathnaka is an eater of dreams, and even the denizens of a dream can have dreams of their own.  The Red King's dreams sustain the shadows as they try to consume both Wonderland and Arkham.  You grimace with pity as you deliver the merciful killing blow to the Red King.\n"
"As the death blow lands, the shadows retreat from the castle with an echoing shriek.  The remaining red chess pieces, however, turn to retire without any sound or expression.  Perhaps some core principle drives them to obey the rules of chess even when controlled by Gurathnaka's shadows.  Whatever the reason, you're relieved that you won't have to fight your way back out of the castle.\n"
"You return wearily across the battlefield to the opposing castle of the White King, who meets you proudly.  \"A fine victory, just fine!  I knew I was right to put my confidence - no, wait, it was satisfaction - satisfaction in you!  Come now, we must feast and revel before we go to gloat of our victory to the Red King!\"  You say nothing, not wanting to sour the mood and possibly upset the White King.  If there's one thing you've learned, it's that the inhabitants of Wonderland are notoriously short-tempered.  You give a noncommittal answer and let the king return to his celebration as you quietly depart."

"你小心翼翼地接近倒下的紅棋國王。暗影已不再從他身上冒出，但如果能避免的話，你不打算冒額外的風險。時間一分一秒地過去，什麼事都沒發生，漸漸地，紅棋國王沉重的呼吸聲變大了。你把他翻過來，驚訝地發現儘管國王受傷了，他卻睡著了！你用手張開紅棋國王的眼睛，發現眼睛裡充滿了旋轉的黑暗。即使在這種狀態下，令國王著魔的暗影力量仍維持著他的生命。你思考著各種可能性，很快你就想到了原因。古拉斯納卡是夢境的吞噬者，而即使是仙境的居民也擁有自己的夢境。在暗影試圖吞噬仙境和阿卡姆時，紅棋國王的夢境維持著暗影。你的表情因憐憫而扭曲，揮出攻擊將紅棋國王毫無痛苦地殺死。\n"
"隨著致命一擊落下，暗影在迴盪的尖叫聲中從城堡裡撤退。而剩下的紅棋棋子無聲無息地轉身退下。也許即使被古拉斯納卡的影子控制，某些核心的原則仍驅使著他們遵守西洋棋規則。不管什麼原因，能不費力氣地從城堡裡逃出來，讓你鬆了一口氣。\n"
"你疲憊地穿過戰場回到對面的白棋國王的城堡，他驕傲地接見了你。“一場很好的勝利，非常好！我知道我是對的，把信心——不，等等，是滿意——對你滿意！來吧，在我們向紅棋國王吹噓我們的勝利之前，我們必須大肆慶祝！”你什麼都沒說，不想壞了白棋國王的心情，甚至可能會惹惱他。如果你學到了什麼教訓，那就是仙境的居民是出名的脾氣暴躁。你不置可否地回應，然後趁著國王忙著他的慶祝活動時悄悄地離開。"
