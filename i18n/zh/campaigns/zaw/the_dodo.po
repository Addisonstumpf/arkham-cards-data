msgid "The endless march down the corridor of doors ends at long last as the hallway dead-ends in a small enclave.  In the center of the area stands a glass table with two curious objects on top: a bottle labeled \"DRINK ME,\" and a cake with the words \"EAT ME\" written in its decorations.  You scan the walls for any other way forward, and are shocked to discover an open door, only one that is scarcely knee high and impossible to squeeze through.  With endless wandering as your only alternative, you resolve to find a way through.  Minutes pass without success, and you return to consider the strange refreshments on the glass table.  If this truly is part of Alice's dreams, then there's a chance that they might not be dangerous, and perhaps might even help.  You pop the cork on the bottle and take a wary sip, but the drink's effects quickly flow through you.  At first, it seems like the room is growing larger, but you soon realize that you are shrinking!  You brace for the worst, but find that the effect stops as you reach the right height to easily pass through the tiny door.  At long last, you make your way forward to the sights and sounds of a vast sea."
msgstr "你沿著滿是門的走廊無止盡地前進，終於來到了走廊盡頭的一個小房間。房間的中央有一張玻璃桌，上面放著兩個不尋常的物品：一個標籤上寫著“喝我”的瓶子和一個裝飾上寫著“吃我”的蛋糕。你環視四周的牆壁，尋找任何可以前進的路，然後驚訝地發現一扇敞開的門，僅此一扇，但頂多只有到膝蓋的高度，完全不可能擠得過去。你下定決心要找到通過的方法，但你能做的只是不斷地原地徘徊。幾分鐘過去了，毫無進展，於是你回過頭來考慮玻璃桌上的奇怪點心。如果這裡真的是愛麗絲夢境的一部分，那麼它們可能並不危險，甚至可能會有幫助。你打開瓶子上的軟木塞，小心翼翼地啜了一口，但液體的效果快速流過你全身。一開始，房間似乎越變越大，但你很快就意識到是自己在縮小！你做好了最壞的打算，但你發現當你縮小到剛好可以穿過小門的高度時，藥效就停止了。最後，你向著一片廣闊大海的景象和聲音前進。"

msgid "Seeking Escape"
msgstr "尋找出口"

msgid "The crash of waves dulls as you make your way up the beach.  Each step through the shifting sands seems weighted further as you reflect on your choices and hardships.  Could your journey's end finally be over the next sand dune?  Does Alice's dreamland keep building upon itself infinitely?  Or is Gurathnaka actively warping Wonderland, keeping you from your goal no matter how far you may travel?  Dogged determination pushes you onward even as you question your steps.  Someone has to try to undo this madness, and if not you, then who?  Slowly you proceed, for good or ill."
msgstr "你設法離開海灘時，海浪的撞擊聲逐漸變得沉悶。你思索著自己的選擇和艱辛，而踩在疏鬆沙子上的每一步似乎愈發沉重。你旅程的終點會是下一個沙丘上嗎？愛麗絲的夢境世界是否會自己無限地擴張？或是，古拉斯納卡是否正在扭曲仙境，使你無論旅行多遠都無法接近你的目標？即使懷疑自己的腳步，你還是被頑強的決心推動著繼續前進。一定得有人來嘗試復原這一切的瘋狂，而除了你之外沒有別人了。無論是好是壞，你慢慢地繼續前進。"

"A scene of commotion catches your eye as you step over a small dune and look down toward the shoreline.  A motley pack of animals dashes about, seemingly without direction or destination.  From the center, a Dodo shouts words of action as he runs a short rut in the sand.  \"Yes, that's it!  Up that sandhill there, down the other side!  There's no faster way to get dry!\"\n"
"Dry?  The suggestion seems absurd when most of their paths wander into and out of the surf.  You walk over to investigate the bizarre event, and notice the animals are in a sorry state as you approach closer.  Some of the less hardy creatures have collapsed completely, while others don't appear to be breathing whatsoever.  The Dodo urges them onward all the same, seemingly oblivious to their exhaustion, let alone its own.  \"The race must be run… until the race is won… come, you must join us…\""

"當你跨越一個小沙丘，俯視著海岸線時，一陣騷動的景象吸引了你的注意。一群種類各不相同的動物四處衝刺，看不出有方向或目的地。在中間，一隻渡渡鳥在沙地上一邊跑了一小段，一邊喊著動起來。“對，就是這樣！上去那邊的沙丘，再從另一邊下來！沒有更快的方法來弄乾了！”\n"
"弄乾？這個提議看似荒謬，尤其是牠們大部分的路線都會穿過海浪。你走過去調查這個奇怪的事件，當你靠近時，你注意到動物們都處於一種糟糕的狀態。一些沒那麼結實的生物已經完全累倒了，而其他動物也上氣不接下氣。渡渡鳥仍然不斷催促牠們繼續前進，似乎沒有注意到牠們的疲憊，更別說注意到自己也已經筋疲力竭了。“必須繼續賽跑……直到獲勝……來，你也得加入我們……”"

"You hold the Dodo in place and assure him that the race is over.  \"At last!\" the Dodo cries out, \"The race is over… and everybody has won!\"  The other animals ease to a stop, collapsing onto the sand with relieved groans.  \"There must be prizes for the winners…\" the Dodo rasps, and he looks to you with a wild look as his frail body shivers with exhaustion.  You rifle through your pockets and produce a number of random items, which the animals grab covetously.\n"
"As the surviving racers begin recovering, the Dodo hobbles back over to you.  \"Fair play is satisfied!  We have been running the Caucus Race ever since the pool of tears ran into a sea!  Now at last, we are truly dry!\"  You humor the bird with a polite nod.  \"Finally, we can return to more academic pursuits.  Perhaps I may educate you on several matters?\""

"你抓著渡渡鳥不動，向牠保證比賽已經結束了。“終於！”渡渡鳥喊道：“比賽結束了……所有人都贏了！”其他動物停下腳步，倒在沙灘上，發出解脫的呻吟。“獲勝者一定要有獎品……”渡渡鳥用刺耳的聲音說道，牠瞪大著眼看你，虛弱的身體因疲憊而顫抖著。你在口袋裡翻找，湊齊一些雜物，動物們貪婪地抓住它們。\n"
"當倖存的選手們開始恢復時，渡渡鳥搖搖擺擺地回到你身邊。“這就是體育精神！自從淚水之池變成了大海洋，我們就一直在進行比賽！現在，我們終於真的乾了！”你禮貌性的點點頭，應付這隻鳥。“終於，我們可以回來做更多的學術研究。也許我可以在幾件事上教教你？”"

msgid "You give the Dodo a firm \"n\" and take a few steps back to let the strange animals continue their race without you.  You're not sure what stopping them would accomplish, if anything, but you don't have time to reason with these deluded creatures.  Before you can continue on your way, a rapid change sweeps over the runners.  Each frantic step they take sends out a noise like a cracking bone, and their gaunt bodies begin to wither even further.  The Dodo urges the racers to continue, even as his own body begins to skeletonize.  \"Onward… ever… onwa-\" the Dodo's final urging is cut short as his bones take one final lurch forward and collapse onto the sand.  You stare in bewilderment as the rhythmic sounds of the sea and wind replace the bedlam of the race.  Perhaps Wonderland is just as unstable as Arkham at this point."
msgstr "你堅定地拒絕了渡渡鳥，然後後退幾步，讓奇怪的動物們繼續自己的賽跑。你不知道阻止牠們會有什麼結果，或根本沒有，但你沒有時間和這些被蠱惑的生物講道理。在你繼續自己的旅程之前，這些跑者身上發生了急遽的變化。牠們邁出的每個瘋狂腳步都伴隨著骨頭斷裂般的聲音，牠們憔悴的身體開始變得更加萎縮。渡渡鳥催促著牠們繼續跑，即使牠自己的身體開始變成骸骨。“向前……繼續……向……”當渡渡鳥的骨骸向前踉蹌，倒在沙灘上時，牠最後的催促聲終於停止了。大海和海風帶著節奏的聲音取代了比賽的喧鬧聲，你困惑地凝視著。也許現在仙境就和阿卡姆一樣不穩定。"

msgid "You depart from the bizarre spectacle, following the shoreline steadily.  Landmarks are far and few between, making the beach seem endless in either direction.  As you ponder where to head next, the sound of the sea wind changes, and you hear faint tones resembling Alice's voice, though the words are indiscernible.  You look out over the surf, and to your astonishment, the tide recedes all at once, leaving behind an arrangement of stones and shells.  The debris portrays a vague map of your current position, with a series of arrows pointing down the beach and then inland.  You breathe a sigh of relief as you make mental notes of the map's layout.  No matter what lunacy may lie ahead, this is Alice's dream at its core.  You don't know what degree of influence she holds over Wonderland in this state, but it's one less burden on your shoulders."
msgstr "你離開了怪異的奇特場面，沿著海岸線持續前進。海灘上景物稀少，而且相距很遠，使得海灘每個方向都似乎無窮無盡。就在你思考接下來的方向時，海風的聲音變了，你聽到了很像是愛麗絲的聲音的微弱語調，但卻聽不清楚字句。你望向海浪，令你大感驚訝的是，潮水一下子就退去，留下一堆排列過的石頭和貝殼。這些碎片畫出模糊的地圖，標示出你目前的位置，一排箭頭指向海灘，然後指向內陸。你一邊在腦海中記下地圖的排列，一邊鬆了一口氣。不管前方有什麼瘋狂在等著你，根本來說這些都是愛麗絲的夢。你不確定她在目前的狀態下還能對仙境造成多少影響，但這些至少減輕了你肩上的一點負擔。"
