"Another obstacle blocks your passage through Wonderland, this time in the form of a vast brick wall.  It stretches towards the horizon in either direction, making you doubt if a way around it exists.  Climbing doesn't seem to be an option either, as it stands at the height of a house without any possible footholds.  Exasperated, you begin walking its length in hopes of finding any kind of door or passage through.\n"
"Some distance down the wall, you spot a rotund figure perched atop it.  As you draw close, the silhouette of an egg with legs grows clearer.  You doubt your own eyes for a moment, but who else could it possibly be but Humpty Dumpty from the old nursery rhyme?  He sits atop the wall with his eyes closed and his fist on his chin (or at least the part of his body that passes for his chin) in deep thought.  You call up to him, but he hisses down at you.\n"
"\"Don't speak!  Move away!  Or you might bring the end about quicker!\" Humpty spits at you, trying to remain oblivious to you.  You insist in confusion, and finally he looks down at you with a mixture of annoyance and dread.  \"Now you've done it!  I was safe while I was deep in ponderance!\"  You question whether the word means what he thinks, but he shakes his head - or himself, rather.  \"When I use a word, it means precisely what I wish it to mean!  Otherwise, what good would it be?\"  You decide not to press him on that point and ask again about the end he mentioned earlier.\n"
"\"The end, don't you see?  The others may not see it, but surely you can.  I can recognize one of Alice's ilk when I see one, not from Wonderland at all.  You know as well as I that this land is but a dream, and I, drawn from a sad and dismal tale, am doomed to a gravitic fate!\"  You begin to see Humpty's worries.  Sat on a wall, had a great fall, couldn't be put back together again.  You assert that the children's story and his existence are two separate things, but his expression only grows darker.  \"It's no use!  The printed word is my fate, and that's the end of it.  It's simply my means to an end, and always has been.\"  Humpty's stare grows unfocused, and he begins to wobble atop the wall."

"又一個障礙物阻擋了你穿越仙境的路，這次是一堵巨大的磚牆。它兩側都向著地平線延伸，使你懷疑是否有繞過去的方法。攀爬似乎也不可行，因為牆和一棟房子差不多高，也沒有任何可能的立足點。你惱怒地開始沿著牆走，希望找到任何類型的門或通道。\n"
"沿著牆走了一段距離後，你看到一個圓圓的身影坐在牆上。當你接近時，它的輪廓變得更加清晰，像是長了腿的蛋。你一時之間懷疑自己的眼睛，但這不就是古老的童謠中的蛋頭先生嗎？他坐在牆頂，閉著眼睛沉思，拳頭放在下巴上(或者至少是他身體對應於下巴的那個部分)。你朝上呼喊他，但他對你發出噓聲。\n"
"“不要講話！走開！不然你可能會讓結局更快到來！”蛋頭先生朝你吐口水，試圖假裝你不存在。你在困惑中繼續叫他，終於他低頭看著你，眼中混合著惱怒和恐懼。“這下好了！本來我陷在重思的時候，是很安全的！”你問他這個詞的意思是不是指他在想的東西，但他搖搖頭——或者說是搖搖他的身體。“我用一個字詞的時後，它的意思就是我希望它代表的意思！否則，它有什麼用？”你決定別在這個點上深究，再次詢問他關於之前提到的結局。\n"
"“結局，你不懂嗎？其他人可能不懂，但你肯定能。我能認出和愛麗絲的同類，絕對不是來自仙境。你和我一樣清楚，這片土地不過是一個夢境，而我，來自一個悲傷而淒涼的故事，注定要遭受沉重的命運！”你開始理解蛋頭先生的憂慮。他坐在牆上，摔了下去，變得支離破碎。你告訴他小孩子的故事和他的存在是兩件不同的事情，但他的表情只是變得更陰暗。“沒用的！印在紙上的故事就是我的命運，那就是結局。結局就是我的意義，一直都是。”蛋頭先生的目光變得渙散，開始在牆上晃來晃去。"

msgid "\"Accept?!\" Humpty scoffs, steadying himself to continue his tirade.  \"Why I've a good mind to come down there and show you precisely why I should accept it!\"  He begins to clamber down the wall, more sliding than climbing and slipping at several points, but he reaches the ground unscathed.  Humpty wags a finger up at you as he continues ranting.  \"Simply don't accept it, what an utterly intangible thought!  What reason should I have to believe that I should survive a fall from up-\" he points up to his former perch and pauses in thought, \"-up there.  Down to… here?\"  Humpty takes a quick stock of his surroundings and kneads the grass beneath his shoes as the truth dawns on him.  \"I'm… vivacious!  Undisturbed!  There was no great fall or failure to repurpose my pieces!\"  He leaps into the air and clicks his heels in joy as you simply stand by and watch, bemused.  Humpty revels for a few moments longer before he grabs your hand and shakes it vigorously.  \"Well met indeed, then!  You've assuredly granted me a new perspective.  Why, I might do a great many other things now that I've regained myself!\"  You tell Humpty to take it easy for a while, not wanting to turn him into a daredevil.  His fate is his own, but an egg's still an egg."
msgstr "“接受？！”蛋頭先生嗤之一笑，穩住身體來繼續他的長篇大論。“我就好心下去，告訴你我為什麼要接受它！”他開始爬下牆壁，大多是用滑的而不是用爬的，溜了好幾次，但他毫髮無傷地到達了地面。蛋頭先生一邊朝你揮動手指，一邊繼續咆哮道。“只要不接受就好，這是一個難以理解的想法！我有什麼理由相信我能從墜落中生還，從那邊——”他指著他先前坐的地方，停頓了一下，“——上面那邊，掉到下面……這邊？”蛋頭先生迅速審視了一下周圍的環境，揉了揉鞋底的草，領悟到事情的真相。“我……還活生生的！很完整！沒有大摔落或大失敗等著迎接我！”他高興地跳起來，腳後跟互相撞擊，你只是站在一旁困惑地看著。蛋頭先生又歡欣鼓舞了一會兒，然後抓住你的手，用力地搖晃它。“真是太好了！你無疑地給了我一個全新的觀點。哎，現在我已經找回了自我，我可以做很多其他的事情！”你告訴蛋頭先生放輕鬆點，不想讓他變得太莽撞。他能自己掌握命運，但蛋仍然是蛋。"

msgid "\"Fussing?!\" Humpty screeches, \"it is factually reasonable to fear doom from this height!  Suppose I wobble further like this!\" he rocks himself from side to side to prove his point, making himself more unsteady as he does so.  \"Or back to forward like so!\"  He tilts out over the wall and back as he further demonstrates his fear.  You try to get Humpty to stop his hyperbole, but he doesn't listen at all.  \"It's vital for the both of us that you understand the peril I could find myself in!  And if you don't believe me, then-\" Humpty stops mid-sentence as he realizes his wild rocking has upset his balance completely.  He claws at the bricks in a moment of panic, but it's too late to stop from careening over the edge.  You try to help break his fall, but his wild earlier motions send him on a strange trajectory.  Humpty's wail of terror ends abruptly as his body crashes onto the ground, shattering like a vase.  You shake your head at the egg's shortsightedness and look over his remains.  It would be an impossible task fitting him back together, and whether or not that would actually revive him is anyone's guess.  There isn't much you can do now but press on and hope that Wonderland's other inhabitants will be more open to reason."
msgstr "“大驚小怪？！”蛋頭先生尖叫道，“在這個高度害怕厄運到來是很合理的！假如我像這樣更加搖搖晃晃！”他左右搖晃自己以證明自己的論點，使他自己更加不穩。“或者像這樣前後搖晃！”他向牆外傾斜，又晃回來，進一步展現他恐懼的事。你試圖讓蛋頭先生停止他誇張的展示，但他根本聽不進去。“對於我們倆來說，理解我可能陷入的危險至關重要！如果你不相信我，那麼——”蛋頭先生意識到他狂野的搖擺完全破壞了他的平衡，話語倏地停止。他驚慌失措地抓著磚塊，但已經太遲了，來不及阻止自己翻落牆緣。你試圖幫助他減緩跌勢，但他之前狂野的動作讓他用奇怪的軌跡掉落。蛋頭先生恐怖哭叫聲戛然而止，身體倒在地上，像破碎花瓶一樣。你為這顆蛋的目光短淺搖了搖頭，看著他的殘骸。將他重新拼湊起來將是一項不可能完成的任務，而且誰也說不準這是否真的能讓他復活。現在你已無能為力，只能繼續旅程，希望仙境裡的其他居民能夠更理性一點。"

"With the matter of Humpty Dumpty behind you, the problem of the wall remains.  The wall might very well be infinite, if Alice's dreams are, and without so much as a tree to use in scaling the wall, you'll have to double back and find another way.  Before you can act, however, the sound of scraping bricks meets your ears.  You scan the wall for the source of the sound, but you can't pinpoint it.  Upon closer inspection, the entire wall seems to be trembling slightly.  A tremendous rumbling begins to sound through the bricks, and you take several steps backward, looking down to either end of the wall.  The top layer of the wall rises like a wave, and a ripple of displaced masonry works down from either end, looking to meet up at your spot.  You leap backward even further as the bricks collide with a crash, and a cloud of powdered mortar obscures your vision.\n"
"The dust settles quickly in the silence of the aftermath, and the wall before you has been cracked at the top, with loose bricks now forming a rough ramp upward.  Once again, you can only attribute such swift and dramatic assistance as Alice's influence on her own dreams, helping to guide you along.  With another obstacle eliminated, you climb the mound of debris and easily pass through the fissure in the brick wall."

"蛋頭先生的事已經過去了，但是牆的問題依舊還在。如果愛麗絲的夢境是無限的，那麼這堵牆很可能也是無限的，而且沒有類似樹木之類的可以用來爬牆，你將不得不原路返回尋找別的路。然而，在你採取行動之前，刮磚塊的聲音就傳到了你的耳朵裡。你掃視牆壁尋找聲音的來源，但你無法找到位置。更仔細查看，整面牆似乎都在微微顫抖。巨大的隆隆聲開始透過磚塊響起，你向後退了幾步，看向牆的兩端。牆的表層像波浪一樣升起，磚石的錯位像漣漪般從兩端往你移動，在你的位置相遇。當磚塊相撞發出撞擊聲時，你向後退得更遠，一團粉塵遮住了你的視線。\n"
"塵埃在寂靜的餘波中迅速落下，你面前的牆壁頂部已經裂開，鬆散的磚塊堆形成了一個粗糙的斜坡。你只能再一次將這種迅速且戲劇性的幫助歸因於愛麗絲影響了她自己的夢境，幫助引導你前進。障礙再次消除，你爬上瓦礫堆，輕鬆穿過磚牆的裂縫。"
