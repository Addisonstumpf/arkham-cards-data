"There are no established roads through the dense woodlands.  Each trampled trail you find works aimlessly back upon itself to the point where you make better progress forging your own path.  You walk for hour after hour, staving off the strange creatures and trying your best to make sense of the baffling landscape.  Your progress is further hampered as a thick fog creeps over the woods.  You can barely see the distance from one tree to the next, slowing your pace to a staggered walk.  Gradually, you discover an aroma mixed in with the fog, faint but strangely exotic.  The fog slowly transitions to smoke, giving you no further vision, but a clear trail.  You follow the strengthening smell to a secluded copse, covered on every available surface by a hundred varieties of mushroom.\n"
"Atop one of the mushrooms sits a large caterpillar lounging with a hookah beside him.  His eyes rise to meet yours, but he reacts with complete indifference.  \"Who are YOU?\" the Caterpillar demands with smoke streaming from his pursed lips.  You open your mouth to explain, but the insect holds up one of his many arms.  \"Explain once you are the correct size.\"  He breaks off a piece of his toadstool seat and holds it up lazily.  \"This will correct you.\"  You accept with no small amount of consideration, assuring yourself that this is the one case where you would reasonably take mushrooms from a talking caterpillar.  Within moments of taking the bite, you shrink down to a minuscule size.  Satisfied with looking down at you, the Caterpillar takes another long drag of smoke before he continues.  \"The other side will make you grow larger,\" he instructs, breaking off another piece from the opposite side of his mushroom and offering it to you.  \"Now speak.  Who are YOU?\"\n"
"It's a difficult task explaining the events that brought you here, made all the more uncomfortable by the Caterpillar's apparent lack of interest and attention.  \"Stop,\" he orders at last, drawing upward slightly, \"Where you have been and what you have done are quite different from who you are.\"  You try to tell a bit of your background and motivations instead, but the Caterpillar remains dismissive of your story.  \"You are not the same as you used to be,\" he accuses with a snort, \"Everyone changes, but you have changed far too quickly.  Discover yourself once more.\"  His many hands extend, offering his hookah pipe down toward you."

"沒有既成的道路可以穿過茂密的森林。每條你發現的足踏林徑都漫無目的地接回原路，直到你決定自行開闢道路，才稍微有進展。你連續走了幾個小時，避開怪異的生物，盡力理解這令人困惑的景色。濃霧籠罩在樹林中，更加阻礙了你的前進。你幾乎無法從一棵樹看到另一棵樹，這讓你放慢了腳步，蹣跚而行。漸漸地，你發現了一種淡淡的香氣混合在霧中，帶著奇異的異國情調。霧慢慢地變成了煙，雖然你還是看不到更遠的地方，但卻能跟著煙霧清晰的軌跡。你隨著愈發濃烈的氣味來到一個僻靜的樹叢，樹叢可以長蘑菇的地方都覆蓋著近百種各種各樣的蘑菇。\n"
"一個蘑菇頂上坐著一隻大毛毛蟲，旁邊放著一個水煙筒。牠抬起眼，與你四目相對，但牠的反應卻是絲毫不感興趣。“你是誰？”毛毛蟲問道，從牠噘起的嘴裡冒出煙來。你張開嘴正要說話，但這隻蟲卻從牠眾多手臂之中舉起了其中一隻。“等你的大小尺寸合適的時候再解釋。”牠從蘑菇菌傘椅上剝下一小塊，懶洋洋地遞給你。 “這能幫你。”你內心強烈地掙扎了一番，說服自己這就是從會說話的毛毛蟲取得蘑菇的一種合理情境。在咬下去的瞬間，你縮小到一個極微小的尺寸。毛毛蟲滿意地低頭看著你，又吸了一口長煙，才繼續說道，“另一邊會讓你變大。”牠一邊說，一邊從蘑菇的另一邊剝下一塊，遞給你。“現在可以說了。你是誰？”\n"
"把讓你來到這裡的事件解釋清楚是一項艱難的任務，毛毛蟲顯然興趣缺缺，使你更不自在。“停，”牠終於要求道，微微抬起身，“你去過哪裡、做過什麼，和你的本質完全不同。”你試著說了一些你的背景和動機，但毛毛蟲仍然對你的故事不屑一顧。“你和從前的你不一樣了。”牠哼了一聲指責道，“每個人都會變，但你變的太快了。重新審視自己吧。”牠的許多隻手伸出來，將牠的水煙筒朝你遞過來。"

"You take several short puffs of the hookah before your vision blooms with color.  You look to the Caterpillar and find him steadily watching you, perhaps the only anchored figure in the swirling smoke around you.  As the moments pass, you find that the color isn't a figment of your vision at all, but rather a projected light that forms a small mote in the surrounding smoke.  The points of light quickly multiply, shining through the haze in a mosaic pattern.  You look down at yourself to see the colors beaming back onto your body.  Where each light shines, a different facet of yourself manifests.  Courage and conviction intermingled with fear and apprehension.  Talent and ineptitude in equal amounts.  Shadows creep in at the edge of each facet, only to be banished by the overflow from other connecting lights.  The display cascades in front of your eyes with increasing violence, overwhelming your senses and spiking into your mind.  You lose track of the time as moments slip by in dazzling flashes.\n"
"Suddenly, your eyes snap open.  You are lying on the ground, nothing above you but the clouds of smoke, and no sound but the rushing of blood in your ears.  Your muscles slowly relax as your breathing normalizes and the forest ambiance fades back in.  The smoke parts around the stoic face of the Caterpillar, still watching you intently.  He scrutinizes you carefully, then at last gives a satisfied nod and long exhale of smoke.  \"You have found yourself, then,\" he states drolly, returning to his reclining position.  \"When you change now, it will be for the better.\"  You don't know what the Caterpillar expected, but you weren't prepared for this sort of introspective crisis.  Were you still yourself?  Was this all to spark some future change in you?  Or was it preventing a change by making you conscious of it now?  You rise with the intention of pressing the Caterpillar on what he just did to you, but to your surprise he has vanished completely back into the smoke.  You wait tensely, but in vain as even the exotic scent that led you to the Caterpillar fades away.  All you can do now is continue on your search through Wonderland, a little warier if nothing else."

"你抽了幾口水煙，然後視線裡綻放出色彩。你看著毛毛蟲，發現牠一直在注視著你，也許是你周圍天旋地轉的煙霧中唯一固定的身影。隨著時間的流逝，你發現色彩不是來自你虛幻的視覺，而是投射出的光線，在你周圍的煙霧中形成微小光點。光點迅速增加，在霧中閃耀著馬賽克般的圖樣。你低頭看著自己，發現色彩重新回到你的身體。每一道光芒照耀的地方，都顯現出你自己的不同的一面。勇氣和信念夾雜著恐懼和憂慮。才能和迂拙是相對等量的。陰影在每個面向的邊緣潛伏著，但被其他連接光線溢出的光芒驅散。畫面在你眼前不斷串聯，愈發激烈，壓倒你的感官並竄入你的腦海。在令人眼花繚亂的閃光之中，光陰流逝，而你已迷失時間。\n"
"你突然猛地睜開了眼睛。你躺在地上，你的上方只有雲一般的煙霧；沒有半點聲音，只聽得見耳朵裡血液的鼓動。隨著呼吸恢復正常，你的肌肉慢慢放鬆，森林的氛圍逐漸淡入。煙霧在毛毛蟲堅忍的臉周圍散開，牠仍然專注地注視著你。牠仔細打量你，最後滿意地點點頭，長長地吐了口煙。“那麼，你已經找到了自己，”牠滑稽地說道，回到牠斜倚的姿勢。“現在你做出改變時，會往好的方向。”你不知道毛毛蟲預期的是什麼，但你並沒有準備好要面對這場內省的危機。你還是你自己嗎？這一切都是為了能激發你未來做出一些改變嗎？還是透過讓你意識到變化，來防止改變？你站起來，打算逼問毛毛蟲對你做了什麼，但令你驚訝的是，牠已經完全消失在煙霧中。你緊張地等了一會兒，但徒勞無功，就連引領你來到毛毛蟲這裡的的奇特氣味也消失了。你現在唯一能做的就是繼續在仙境中探索，真要說的話，也許更加謹慎一點。"

"The Caterpillar's indifference sours as he angrily yanks the pipe back at your refusal.  \"If you refuse illumination, then regret will be your only teacher!\" he snaps, sticking the pipe back into his own mouth.  You scowl in annoyance and prepare to give the Caterpillar a good talking to, but you stop mid-breath.  As the insect bitterly puffs on the hookah, shadows from the surrounding glade begin to collect inside him.  With each inhalation, he grows larger and more alien.  His scowling face grows feral, and he gnaws on the pipe the more it changes.  You take several steps back from the Caterpillar as he draws upward in a predatory stance.\n"
"Remembering the mushroom, you quickly devour the second piece he gave you, growing back to your normal size just ahead of the Caterpillar's own transformation.  The monster does not stop swelling, however, and you flee the smoky glade as trees splinter and fall behind you.  You focus on the mad dash ahead, still unable to see ahead more than a few yards, but spurred onward by the sound of cracking timber and scuttling of a dozen insect legs.  Something lashes out at you, barely missing your side and forcing you to veer off and slide down a mossy slope.  You barely keep your balance and crawl into a hollow log for respite.  Moments stretch to minutes, but the sounds of the mutated Caterpillar have vanished completely into the surrounding haze.  You wait in shaken silence for a few minutes more before finally crawling back out warily."

"對於你的拒絕，毛毛蟲憤怒地把煙斗拿回來，牠的漠不關心變成了厭煩。“如果你拒絕受啟發，那麼你就只能從遺憾之中學習教訓！”牠厲聲道，把煙斗塞回自己的嘴裡。你惱怒地皺起眉頭，準備要好好和毛毛蟲談談，但你一口氣還沒提上來就打斷了。當這隻蟲在水煙筒上痛苦地吸吐時，周圍空地的暗影開始往牠體內聚集。每吸一口，牠就變得更大，更陌異。牠皺著眉頭的表情變得兇惡，咬著愈發變化的菸斗。當毛毛蟲以攻擊性的姿勢抬起身體時，你連連倒退了好幾步。\n"
"你想起那些蘑菇，迅速地吃掉牠給你的第二塊，搶在毛毛蟲的變形之前恢復到正常大小。但怪蟲並沒有停止膨脹，你逃離了煙霧繚繞的林間空地，樹木裂成碎片，在你身後倒下。你專心瘋狂地往前方衝刺，雖仍無法看清前方超過幾碼的距離，但木材破裂的聲音和十幾條蟲腿的撞擊聲逼迫著你繼續前進。有什麼東西衝向你，幾乎從你身邊擦過，逼得你轉向，滑下長滿苔蘚的斜坡。你勉強保持平衡，爬進一個空心的樹幹來喘口氣。幾分鐘過去了，突變毛毛蟲的聲音已經完全消失在周圍的霧霾中。你在顫抖的沉默中又等了幾分鐘，然後小心翼翼地爬了出來。"

The eerie silence is gently lifted as a small current of air begins to blow through the forest.  The fog separates around a long funnel of rushing air, providing you with both vision and a path through the forest.  You follow the wind, hearing faint notes in the rushing air that remind you of the everyday sounds of Arkham.  Could this be Alice's doing, manipulating her dreams to lead you home?  You cling to your memories as you follow the current of air hopefully forward."
msgstr "你再次離開了霧濛濛的森林，試圖找出自己身處何處，以繼續旅程。你幾乎找不到地標，似乎又要碰運氣了。一股微小的氣流開始吹過樹林，詭異的寂靜輕輕地解除了。風吹成一個長長的漏斗，圍繞四周的霧被分開，讓你看見一條穿越森林的路徑。你跟隨著風，在疾速的空氣中聽到微弱的語調，讓你想起阿卡姆日常生活的聲音。難道這是愛麗絲做的，操控她的夢境，指引你回家？你以自己的回憶作為支柱，隨著氣流滿懷希望地前進。"
