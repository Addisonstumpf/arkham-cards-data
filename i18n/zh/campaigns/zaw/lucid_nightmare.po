msgid "Out the Looking-Glass"
msgstr "穿出鏡子"

msgid "The scattered petals weave an inconstant route over the meadows and dales.  Your doubts are silenced as the flowers scatter in sight of an English country home, this one much more familiar.  The house is identical to the strange empty one that manifested in Arkham, though it is mirrored from what you remember.  You enter the house with a rush of excitement all the same, though uncertain what you will find inside.  Unlike the barren cottage you explored not so long ago, this house is filled with an uncomfortable clutter, and most of it levitating in random spots.  Finding a passage through the rooms proves more difficult than you expected, but at last you make your way to the strange parlor you briefly viewed through the mirror in Arkham.  A mirror also adorns this mantle, but the reflection is clouded by darkness, so much that you can barely make out your own image on it.  You place a hand on the mirror and press gently, and it bows like a rotted timber.  With few other options, you scale the fireplace and lean forward into the malleable mirror."
msgstr "散落的花瓣在草地和山谷上編織出一條變幻的路線。你內心的疑慮隨著鮮花散落在英式鄉村住宅的景色中，這是一間更為熟悉的屋子。這間屋子與阿卡姆中出現的奇怪的空房子一模一樣，就好像它是從你記憶中映射出來的。雖然不知道會在裡面找到什麼，你還是帶著一股興奮的心情走進屋子。與你不久前探索的那個荒廢小屋不同，這間房子堆滿了多到令人不舒服的雜物，而且大部分都隨機地四處漂浮著。找到穿過房間的通道比你想像的要困難，但最終你還是來到了一個奇怪客廳，就是你在阿卡姆的鏡子裡曾經短暫看到過的地方。有一面同樣裝飾著布幔的鏡子，但鏡子的反射蒙著一層黑暗，你幾乎無法辨認出自己映在鏡子裡的模樣。你將一隻手放在鏡子上，稍微按下去，它像腐爛的木頭一樣彎曲。在幾乎沒有其他選擇的情況下，你爬上壁爐，向前探入能變形的鏡子。"

msgid "Out the Rabbit Hole"
msgstr "跳出兔子洞"

msgid "Following the map to the best of your abilities, you skirt the water's edge before cutting inland sharply.  Some short distance through the underbrush, your path reaches its terminus at a door embedded in a dirt hillock.  With no reason to hesitate, you open the door and squeeze inside.  The other side doesn't match up with your expectations at all, appearing as a labyrinth of thousands of doors down several branching corridors.  Wearily, you trudge forward, picking a path and proceeding methodically.  Your method soon gives way to madness, however, as the tight corridors open up and the walls seem to fall away from you, as if ejecting from reality altogether.  Gravity turns at random, and you struggle for footing as the long hallways funnel up and down.  As the dread of being forever lost begins to grow, a blinding light beams down at you from a narrow tunnel.  Your footing slips once again, and you begin falling - upward, it seems - toward it.  With scant seconds to brace, you ready yourself for the worst."
msgstr "你盡你所能跟著地圖走，繞過水邊，然後急速切入內陸。穿過灌木叢一小段距離後，你的路徑到達了終點，有一扇嵌在泥土小丘裡的門。你沒有猶豫的理由，打開門擠了進去。門的另一邊和你的預期完全不同，看起來像迷宮，在幾條分岔的走廊上有著數千扇的門。儘管很疲憊，你仍拖著腳步往前走，有系統地選擇一條路前進。然而，瘋狂很快就讓你的方法失效了，狹窄的走廊變寬，牆壁似乎從你身旁掉落，彷彿完全脫離了現實。重力忽上忽下，長長的走廊像漏斗般上下移動，你掙扎著想站穩腳步。當你開始害怕要永遠迷失在這裡時，從一個狹窄的隧道中射出一道耀眼的光線籠罩著你。你再次滑倒，開始墜落——但似乎是往上——朝著那個隧道。只有幾秒鐘的時間能應變，你為最壞的情況做好了準備。"

msgstr "解開阿卡姆"

msgid "You emerge to a view of utter pandemonium.  From the damaged landmarks you can identify, you stand on the border between Arkham's Northside and Merchant District, though the former seems nothing more than a shadowy void.  From the fading twilight, you can only conclude that you've been gone from Arkham a matter of minutes, in spite of the days and nights you spent in Wonderland.  Your bewildered observation is interrupted by an unearthly noise, one that you know in your soul could only be made by one thing.  You turn toward the south side of the city to gaze at the shadowy form of Gurathnaka."
msgstr "你現身的地方是一片地獄般的景色。從還能辨認的損壞地標中，你認出你站在阿卡姆北區和商人區之間的交界處，但北區似乎只剩一個暗影般的虛空。儘管你在仙境中已度過了好幾個日夜，但從逐漸消逝的暮光中，你推斷你只離開了阿卡姆幾分鐘。一種不屬於這個世界的噪音打斷了你困惑的觀察，你打從靈魂深處知道這種聲音唯一的來源。你轉身面向城市的南邊，凝視著古拉斯納卡黑暗的形影。"

msgstr "愛麗絲清醒"

msgid "\"Right this way, dear Alice.  They arrived not a moment ago.\"  From behind you, the familiar tone of the Cheshire Cat sounds, and you catch a glimpse of its fading smile as Alice herself staggers into view.  Her entire body shifts with relief at the sight of you in return.  \"You made it,\" she breathes with disbelief evident in her voice, \"I had hoped in earnest that you would, but in all my dreams-\" Alice winces in sudden pain and clutches her temples as Gurathnaka lets loose another unnatural roar across the shattered cityscape.  You help Alice steady herself and try to gauge her state of mind."
msgstr "“往這兒走，親愛的愛麗絲。他們剛剛到達不久。”柴郡貓熟悉的聲音在你身後響起，當愛麗絲搖搖晃晃地出現在你眼前時，你瞥見了它逐漸消失的微笑。看到你時，愛麗絲的整個身體放鬆了下來。“你成功了！”她的聲音中透露出一絲難以置信，“我原本真心希望你能做到，但在我所有的夢境裡——”古拉斯納卡再次發出邪穢的吼叫聲，響徹整個破碎的城市，而愛麗絲突然痛苦地畏縮著，捂著太陽穴。你扶著愛麗絲，並試著評估她的心裡狀態。"

msgid "Absent Minded"
msgstr "心念缺失"

msgid "Alice looks almost as if she is in shock.  Her eyes jitter slightly as she tries to focus her vision, and she moves as though in a trance.  \"I feel empty, in some strange way,\" Alice murmurs, \"but empty is preferable to dead.\"  You advise Alice not to strain herself, but she shakes her head forlornly as she looks to Gurathnaka across the river.  \"If not now, then when?\""
msgstr "愛麗絲看起來幾乎像是受到了驚嚇。當她試圖集中視線時，她的眼睛微微抖動，動作彷彿在催眠狀態中。“我感覺很空虛，以某種奇怪的方式。”愛麗絲喃喃道，“但空虛總比死掉好。”你建議愛麗絲不要勉強自己，但她無奈地搖搖頭，望向河對岸的古拉斯納卡時。“現在不做，那要等到什麼時候？”"

msgid "Half a Mind"
msgstr "心神恍惚"

msgid "Alice takes several moments to compose herself before she looks to you, still a bit dazed.  \"I feel like a jigsaw puzzle, only halfway finished,\" she says with a hollow voice.  You suggest that Alice take some time to recover, but she refuses as her gaze drifts to Gurathnaka nearby.  \"Rest will only be of help once we've banished these terrible creatures.  I cannot sit idly by.\""
msgstr "愛麗絲花了好一會兒才鎮定下來，然後看向你，仍然有些茫然。“我感覺就像一個只完成了一半的拼圖。”她用空洞的聲音說道。你建議愛麗絲多花一些時間恢復，但她的目光轉向附近的古拉斯納卡，拒絕了你。“只有在我們驅逐了這些可怕的生物後，才能真正好好休息。我不能袖手旁觀。”"

msgid "Presence of Mind"
msgstr "鎮定自若"

msgid "Alice grits her teeth and her eyes snap open, conviction shining in them.  \"I feel the strain of those monsters on my mind, but I can bear it.\"  You try to help Alice to a more comfortable position to rest, but she places a hand on your shoulder reassuringly.  \"I shall be alright.  It is your city and our world that are most at risk right now.  After all that you have done on my behalf, I must help you however I can.\""
msgstr "愛麗絲咬緊牙關，猛地睜開眼睛，眼中閃爍著堅定的信念。“我感受到了那些怪物的拉扯，但我撐得住。”你試著幫愛麗絲換一個更舒適的姿勢休息，但她將一隻手放在你的肩膀上，讓你放心。“我沒事的。現在最危險的是你的城市、我們的世界。你為我做了這麼多，我必須盡我所能幫助你。”"

Its hunger is bottomless, and its minions take after their master in fighting over the scraps of the most decadent feast of all.  Alice is kept alive throughout, and she holds out hope that somewhere, someone in the world can reverse this cataclysm, but in vain.  The great masters of magic and mystery have no time to prepare against Gurathnaka's hunger, and what little resistance they offer does as much good as a candle in a coffin.  Shadows eclipse the Earth, and only once every other molecule has been consumed do the fiends turn and devour Alice and her dreams.

Your thoughts aren't fully sorted by the time a nurse enters with a small meal for you.  \"You're awake already!  Can you remember the last thing that happened to you?\"  You probe with general questions, trying to figure out just what has happened to Arkham, but the nurse isn't concerned in the least.  The shadows, the brief overlap with Wonderland, and the distorting chaos all fail to get any reaction out of her, other than a suspicious smile.  \"Now it's none of my business, but you really ought to be more careful if you're, erm… drinking anything stronger than water.  Next time, you could end up with more than a few bruises!  Don't worry, your secret is safe here.\"  You attempt to reason with the nurse, but she simply pats you on the hand and insists you eat.  Frustration takes a back seat to practicality, and you accept the food reluctantly, though you still insist that you be given a newspaper as soon as possible."

"你被裂隙崩塌的力量推倒在地，一股狂風在你身邊像鞭子般刮過，你蹲下來躲避。神奇的變化讓現實重新排序，徹底恢復了北區和商業區暫時崩毀的混亂局面。你將手指戳進鵝卵石的縫隙中撐著，在一團混亂中保住寶貴的性命。愛麗絲從附近的燈柱猶疑地看著你，你們的視線交會了一瞬間，然後你的視線就被耀眼的光芒蒙蔽了。\n"
"當你再次睜開眼睛時，你面前是聖瑪麗醫院一間病房裡單調的牆紙和昏暗的燈光。你搖搖晃晃地坐起來，對於戰鬥最後時刻的記憶模糊且片段。當護士為你送來少許食物時，你還沒完全整理好思緒。“你醒來了！你還記得發生在你身上的最後一件事嗎？”你用一些普通的問題試探，試著弄清楚阿卡姆發生了什麼事，但護士對此一點也不擔心。暗影、與仙境暫時的交疊，還有扭曲的混亂，都沒有讓她有任何反應，除了懷疑的笑容。“雖然不關我的事，但如果你要，呃……喝一些比水還更猛的東西，真的應該更加小心。下一次，你可能不會只有幾處瘀傷！別擔心，我會保守你的秘密。”你試著和護士辯解，但她只是拍拍你的手，叫你吃東西。挫敗感輸給了實際需求，你不情願地接受了食物，但你仍然堅持要盡快給你一份報紙。"
