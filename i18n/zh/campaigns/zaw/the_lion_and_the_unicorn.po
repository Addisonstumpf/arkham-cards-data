"It's difficult to judge how far you've trekked through Wonderland.  Milestones and landmarks are few and far between, which makes the finding of an actual road all the more welcome.  A simple dirt lane cuts a surprisingly direct path through the countryside.  You follow it with anticipation building inside you as the dusty earth transitions to loose gravel and finally orderly cobblestones.  You scarcely have time to hope for any sort of relief before you arrive at the outskirts of a derelict village.\n"
"It's clear that Gurathnaka's minions have ripped this town apart.  Each stone wall bears the same deep gouges that you have seen from other sites of their attacks.  You watch each darkened corner of the village as you walk further into its heart.  As you near the center of the small town, the sounds of commotion grow steadily louder.  You peer around a corner cautiously and gawk at the sight coming from the village square.\n"
"A lion and a unicorn, standing on two legs each and back to back, are fending off an advancing crowd of shadowy beasts.  You watch in amazement for several moments as the two expertly combat the dark creatures.  However, as the din of combat begins to fade to ambiance, you begin to catch smatterings of conversation from the pair of animals.\n"
"\"You're slacking!  Positively slacking against these fiends!\" the Unicorn calls out from amid the melee, \"you're going to make us miss the refreshments!\"\n"
"\"Your complaining slows you!\" the Lion retorts with a growl, \"I fight twice as hard as you ever could!\"  The two continue their brawl, glancing with irritation at each other whenever they can spare a glance.  You consider that the two may have once been rivals before being forced into fighting the shadows together.  With each passing second, each works to deliberately put the other at a disadvantage.  Their wider swings clip each other, their poor footing trips the other, and their exchanges grow more and more volatile.  At the rate that they're destroying their own fighting chances, you have only a small window to act."

"很難判斷你在仙境中已跋涉了多遠。里程標記或地上景觀很稀少而且相距甚遠，這使得你對於能找到一條真正的道路更加感到欣慰。一條簡單的泥土小道出乎意料地直接穿過了鄉間。你沿著路走，當泥土地漸漸變為鬆散的礫石，最後變成整齊的鵝卵石時，你內心也漸漸充滿期待。你幾乎沒有時間做好心理準備，就來到了一個廢棄村莊的外緣。\n"
"顯然古拉斯納卡的爪牙已經把這個小鎮摧殘殆盡。每面石牆上都有深深的鑿痕，和你在其他受到攻擊的地方看到的一樣。你盯著村莊裡的每個被暗影侵蝕的角落，繼續走向村莊中心。你越靠近中心，傳來的騷動的聲音就越來越大聲。你在轉角處小心翼翼地偷瞄，然後目瞪口呆地看著村莊廣場的景象。\n"
"一頭獅子和一隻獨角獸，各自用兩條腿站著，背靠著背，抵擋著一群進犯的暗影野獸。有一會兒，你驚嘆地看著他們熟練地與黑暗生物戰鬥。然而，隨著戰鬥的聲音逐漸淡出背景，你開始聽到這兩個動物零星的對話。\n"
"“你在偷懶！對付這些惡魔越來越懈怠！”獨角獸在混戰中喊道，“你會讓我們錯過點心的！”\n"
"“你的抱怨才讓你變慢了！”獅子咆哮著反駁道，“我的戰鬥力至少是你的兩倍！”他們繼續爭吵，只要有空檔，就互相怒氣沖沖地瞪對方一眼。你覺得他們兩人可能原本是競爭對手，然後才被迫一起對抗暗影。隨著一秒一秒過去，他們開始故意使對方處於不利的位置。他們揮舞的動作越來越大，互相碰撞；站位越來越糟，互相絆倒；他們的爭吵越來越多也越來越激烈。以他們毀掉自己的戰鬥勝機的速度，你只有很短暫的時間可以採取行動。"

"You decide that the risk of facing down another horde of shadows is worth gaining a few new allies.  You rush out from the building and begin pummeling the closest of Gurathnaka's minions.  The Lion and the Unicorn regard you strangely, but allow you to join them in standing back to back against the shadows.  You bark orders at them to shape up and focus on their foes, and while the rivals don't respond verbally, they obey to keep the fight going.\n"
"You've never seen this many of the shadows attacking the same spot at once.  Their relentless assault doesn't give you an opportunity to consider anything but staying alive, however.  Monster after monster hurl themselves at you, clawing and biting savagely, but repelled time and time again.  For minutes, the melee drags on until at last the flow of enemies evaporates.  You stand raggedly, as do the Lion and the Unicorn, utterly exhausted and not a bit bruised from the attacks.\n"
"\"Plum cake!\" the Lion calls out, and the Unicorn echoes his strange demand, \"this sort of fight deserves a king's refreshment!\"  You don't have anything to offer the duo, though you do pose them several questions.\n"
"\"You may have fought well, but don't think you're anywhere near our mark!\" the Unicorn brags down to you, \"the crown must go to one of us two - me to be precise.\"  The Lion scoffs and attempts to rebuff the claim, but you ignore his grumbling.  You explain that whatever crown they're fighting for is nowhere to be found.\n"
"\"The blackguards!\" the Lion snorts, \"stolen our - my - crown while they ruined our sport!\"  The Unicorn stamps its hooves in half agreement, calling for the crown.  \"We'll retake the crown and then fight for it once again!  See that we don't!\"  You decide not to raise any further objections as long as they've settled on working together against the shadows.  The less you have to reason with these mad animals, the better a time you'll have."

"你決定值得冒上面對另一群暗影的風險，以獲得一些新的盟友。你衝出建築物，開始接連擊打最靠近的古拉斯納卡爪牙。獅子和獨角獸用奇怪的眼光看著你，但讓你加入他們一起背靠背地對抗暗影。你向他們發出命令，讓他們振作並專注於他們的敵人，雖然這對勁敵沒有口頭回應，但他們有照著做，讓戰鬥得以繼續進行。\n"
"你從來沒有見過這麼多暗影同時攻擊一個地方。然而它們猛烈的攻擊讓你無暇考慮其他事情，只能盡力活下去。怪物一個接一個的向你撲過來，兇猛地抓咬，但也一次次接連地被擊退。混戰持續好幾分鐘，直到最後一批敵人消散。你破破爛爛地站著，獅子和獨角獸也一樣，徹底筋疲力盡，但完全沒有受傷。\n"
"“葡萄乾蛋糕！”獅子喊道，獨角獸應和了他奇怪的要求，“這樣的戰鬥值得得到國王的點心！”你沒有什麼東西可以給這兩位，但你向他們提出了幾個問題。\n"
"“你也許擅長戰鬥，但可別以為你能接近我們的目標！”獨角獸向你吹噓，“王冠必須屬於我們兩個之中——準確地說，是我。”獅子嗤之以鼻，並試圖否定這個說法，但你忽略了他的抱怨。你解釋道，無論他們爭鬥的是什麼王冠，都已無處可尋。\n"
"“那些黑暗守衛！”獅子哼了一聲，“他們破壞我們的競賽的同時偷走了我們的——我的王冠！”獨角獸跺著牠的蹄子，半表示同意，喊著要王冠。“我們要奪回王冠，然後再次為之而戰！看我們的吧！”你決定不再進一步提出任何反對的意見，只要他們決定要一起對抗暗影。與這些瘋顛的動物講道理的次數越少，你的日子就越好過。"

"You hesitate to leap into danger of this caliber with only a slight chance of gaining anything.  You decide to keep hidden and turn your eyes from the fray.  The fighters' sounds of pain and anger are soon drowned by the flood of shadows, and silence returns to the desolate town.  You wait until the shadows fade back into the alleyways before you begin to make your way back out of the village.\n"
"You've scarcely traveled three steps before you hear a warped roar and whinny behind you.  The Lion and the Unicorn, oozing blood and tinged by the shadows, look to you with crazed expressions.  \"Look there!\" the Unicorn cries with a hint of a laugh, \"the thief stands before us in so bold a fashion!\"\n"
"\"Folly!  Folly and madness to stand so boldly!\" the Lion echoes.  You can't imagine what they'd call you a thief for, but with appearances like that, they're clearly beyond reason.  The pair of corrupted beasts lunge forward at you, and you take flight.  Down the twisting alleys of the town they chase you, each time vanishing into dead ends and reappearing from stone walls.  You begin to panic as you try to evade the violent duelists, watching each building with a growing fear.  At last a gap in the streets appears and you sprint out of the small village, still looking over your shoulder and at each piece of terrain as though the Lion and the Unicorn may leap out at you at any moment."

"你猶豫著要不要陷入如此的危險之中，但只有些微的機會能獲得回報。你決定躲藏起來，將你的目光從爭鬥上移開。戰士們痛苦和憤怒的聲音很快就被暗影的洪流淹沒了，寂靜又回到了荒涼的小鎮。你等到暗影消失在小巷裡，然後才開始離開村莊。\n"
"你剛走了兩三步，就聽到身後傳來一陣扭曲的咆哮和嘶鳴聲。獅子和獨角獸身上滲著鮮血，沾染著暗影，用瘋狂的表情看著你。“看看這裡！”獨角獸帶著一絲笑聲叫道，“小偷用很大膽的方式站在我們面前！”\n"
"“愚蠢！如此大膽真是既愚蠢又瘋狂！”獅子應和道。你無法想像牠們為什麼會稱你為小偷，但以牠們這樣的狀況，顯然是沒辦法講理了。這兩頭腐化的野獸向你撲來，而你拔腿就跑。牠們沿著村莊曲折的小巷追逐你，一次又一次消失在死胡同中，又從石牆上重新出現。你試圖躲避這兩個暴力的決鬥者，開始感到恐慌，每個建築物看起來都愈發令人恐懼。最後，街道上出現了一個缺口，你衝出小村莊，仍然提心吊膽地看著每個起伏的地勢，好像獅子和獨角獸隨時都會向你撲過來。"

The ripples of the wind through the tall grass give the appearance of waves of water, until strangely, you spot a hint of blue amid the pale green.  A river begins to wind its way toward you, as if being carved into the land as it traverses the fields.  This cannot be another of Wonderland's random occurrences.  Your thoughts return to Alice as you change course to follow the riverbank trail, wondering if her influence could create such a stream just like that."
