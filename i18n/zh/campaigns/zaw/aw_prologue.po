"The incident was at first assumed to be a case of fatigue and paranoia.  A traveling Englishwoman by the name of Alice Liddell collapsed screaming as the train arrived at Arkham's Northside station.  Other passengers tried to console her, but Ms. Liddell was in a state of sheer panic.  \"The man dressed in newspaper… the goat and the beetle… you saw them too, didn't you?\" she plead to the onlookers, but they only shook their heads in bewilderment.  \"It's still following me, after all this distance… how far will be far enough?!\"  The young woman's panic quickly mounted, and the passengers called for the conductor to escort her off the train.  She begged them not to keep her, that she must continue her journey immediately, but her protests were ignored.  Who could believe such a preposterous story?  You yourself might have doubted her too had you not also seen these strange figures that Alice described in the brief moment before she collapsed.\n"
"You depart the train as soon as possible, but find no trace of Ms. Liddell on the platform.  Porters tell you that the police got involved and decided to take her to Arkham Asylum for temporary care.  You wrinkle your nose at the prospect of the infamous sanitarium doing her any sort of good.  Whatever Alice saw on the train must have existed, however briefly, and you must speak with her to find out what it was and why it fills her with such a powerful dread.  You head home to prepare to have an in-depth talk with Ms. Liddell.\n"
"Arkham has long been plagued by the weird, ghoulish, and arcane.  It may not have been as big a shock to you as it might have been to others, but the fact that a foreigner was affected immediately upon arriving in Arkham strikes you especially oddly.  As you gather your things at home, your mind runs over the hundreds of possible evils that could be haunting Ms. Liddell, each less pleasant than the last.  You pocket some weapons and extra materials on the offchance that you'll have to confront anything sinister.\n"
"Your own house lies across the city from the asylum, giving you plenty of time to speculate as you trek over to Arkham's downtown district.  You hope that it's just your eyes playing on your fears, but the city seems darker than it should be for a summer afternoon."

"這起事件起初被認為是由於疲勞和妄想症引起的。一位名叫愛麗絲·利德爾的英國女性乘客在火車到達阿卡姆北區的車站時尖叫著倒下了。其他乘客試著安撫她，但利德爾女士處在極度恐慌的狀態。“穿著報紙的男人……山羊還有甲蟲……你也看到了嗎？”她向圍觀的人尋求幫助，但他們只是疑惑地搖頭。“它還在跟著我，都這麼遠了……要多遠才夠？！”這位年輕女子的恐慌迅速加劇，於是乘客們找來乘務員護送她下車。她哀求他們不要阻攔她，她必須立即繼續她的旅程，但她的抗議無效。誰會相信如此荒謬的故事？如果不是在愛麗絲在倒下前的短暫瞬間，你也看到了她描述的那些奇怪的角色，你自己也不會相信她。\n"
"你盡快地下了火車，但在月台上卻找不到利德爾女士的踪跡。搬運工告訴你，警察介入並決定帶她到阿卡姆瘋人院臨時安置照護。一想到臭名昭著的療養院能為她帶來什麼幫助，你就皺起了鼻子。不管愛麗絲在火車上看到什麼，儘管很短暫，但一定是真實存在的。你必須與她談談，以了解那是什麼，還有為什麼會讓她感到如此強烈的恐懼。你回到家裡，做好與利德爾女士進行深入交談的準備。\n"
"一直以來，阿卡姆常受到怪異、食屍鬼和神秘事件的侵擾。也許對你來說，這些對你的衝擊不像對其他人那麼強烈，但是一個外國人一到阿卡姆就立即受到影響這件事，讓你感到特別奇怪。當你在家裡收拾東西時，你的腦海裡浮現出數百種可能會影響利德爾女士的邪惡，一種比一種更加地另人感到不安。你帶了一些武器和額外的道具，以防萬一你得面對什麼險惡的東西。\n"
"你的房子與瘋人院之間隔著一整個城市，因此當你穿越阿卡姆市中心的商業區時，你有足夠的時間可以進行推演。這座城市似乎比平常的夏日午後還更加陰暗，你希望這只是你的恐懼導致你的眼睛的錯覺。"
