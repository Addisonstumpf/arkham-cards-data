"The shadows have kept you on edge for too long already in your journey.  Even in an open field where the sun beams down on you from above, you scan the horizon in constant search for any sign of approaching darkness.  Have the shadows been curbed at all by your efforts, or are they unstoppable while their master prepares to feast on Arkham?  The questions tax your psyche further as you continue your trek through Wonderland.\n"
"Your vigilance finally pays off as you spot an airborne figure moving toward you at great speed.  You brace for a fight, but it wheels up high above you, circling like a vulture around a dying animal.  You remain still on the sunny field, dreading what the strange entity might be all the while.  Tense moments pass before the figure descends in a surprising burst of speed and lands in the tall grass before you.  The strange beast before you is equally split between eagle and lion: a gryphon in the flesh if ever there was one, and it regards you curiously as it settles its wings.\n"
"\"Another visitor to Wonderland?  How very peculiar!\"  It leans uncomfortably close to you and strokes the underside of its beak with one claw pensively.  \"You've chosen a poor time for sight-seeing, I'm sorry to say.  The stability of the place has been lacking, and those shadowy beasts have been gnawing about like termites!\"  Your relief at meeting a more congenial resident of Wonderland is quickly replaced by your unease at the Gryphon's statements.  The Gryphon takes note of your concern and nods sagely.  \"Curious to see the trouble yourself?  My, but you're a morbid sort, but it just might take such a sort to sort through it all!\"  The Gryphon chuckles and puffs up a bit at his own play on words, reveling for a moment before turning his side to you.  \"Come, come, don't shy away now!  The only way to see the state of things is from the air!\"  Again you find yourself with conflicting feelings.  On the one hand, this could help you gather information easily, and even assist in your travels.  On the other hand, however, being hundreds of feet up in the air on the back of one of Wonderland's capricious creatures could prove fatal.  Your curiosity wins out in the end, however, and you climb onto the Gryphon's back gingerly."

"在你的旅程中，暗影已經讓你精神緊繃太久了。即使在空曠的田野中，陽光從上方照射在你身上，你也不斷地監視著地平線，尋找任何黑暗接近的跡象。你的努力是否已經能夠抑制了暗影，或是它們是否勢不可擋，而它們的主人正準備在阿卡姆享用大餐？你繼續穿越仙境時，這些懷疑進一步加重了你心理的負擔。\n"
"你的警覺終於發揮作用，你發現一個飛行的身影以極快的速度向你接近。你做好戰鬥準備，但牠在你上方高高地盤旋，就像禿鷹圍繞著垂死的動物一樣。你在陽光明媚的田野上一動不動，害怕著這奇怪的東西是什麼。緊張的時間不斷流逝，直到這個身影以驚人的速度下降並降落在你面前的高高的草上。你面前這頭奇怪的野獸一半像老鷹，一半像獅子：是一隻活生生的獅鷲，如果獅鷲存在的話。牠一邊收起翅膀，一邊好奇地打量著你。\n"
"“另一個仙境的訪客？多麼奇特啊！”牠令你不自在地靠向你，用一隻爪子若有所思地摸著牠的喙底。“你來觀光的時間選的不好，我很遺憾，最近這裡的穩定性很差，那些暗影般的野獸四處啃咬，像白蟻一樣！”遇到一位友善的仙境居民的寬慰感很快就被獅鷲的陳述帶來的不安所取代。獅鷲注意到你的憂慮，聰慧地點點頭。“想親自看看這些麻煩嗎？天啊，你真是個對不好的事感興趣的人，但也許就是需要這種才能才能解決這種事！”獅鷲因自己的用詞重複而咯咯地笑了笑，身軀稍微蓬鬆，陶醉了片刻，然後轉向你。“來來來，現在別害羞了！只有從空中才能看到事情的狀態！”你再次發現自己陷入了矛盾之中。一方面，這可以幫助你輕鬆收集信息，甚至幫助你的旅行。另一方面，騎在仙境中一個善變的生物背上，離地數百英尺高，可能是一件致命的事。然而，你的好奇心最終勝出，你小心翼翼地爬上獅鷲的背。"

"\"Satisfied?\" the Gryphon probes, \"The view is much less dismal from the ground.\"  You consider the state of Wonderland and the shadows once more briefly before you nod.  At once, the Gryphon wheels back down to earth, swooping this time toward a quiet lagoon on the edge of a vast body of water.  \"Come, I know just the thing to liven your spirits after such a sight!  My friend the Mock Turtle is quite a songster, to say nothing of his education!\"  You try to envision just what a mock turtle might look like, but the creature the Gryphon lands next to doesn't match any of your ideas.  The Mock Turtle resembles a sea turtle but with the head of a cow.  He sits at the water's edge, staring down into the pools with a smile on his face, but tears leaking from his eyes.  \"Ahoy and what ho!\" the Gryphon calls out, \"enjoying the dance?\"\n"
"\"It's a sight for sore feet,\" the Mock Turtle murmurs with a nod.  You give the creature a hesitant hello and he waves a flipper at you without looking.  His attention is firmly fixed on the waves in front of him.  You stand beside the Mock Turtle and look into the water, seeing at once a bizarre spectacle.  Sea creatures of a hundred varieties dance together in a complicated but stately fashion just under the water's surface.  The Mock Turtle splashes his flippers in the surf in time with the muffled music, still sniffling but enjoying himself.\n"
"Not wanting to ask the Mock Turtle bluntly, you take the Gryphon aside and quietly question why the creature is in such an emotional state.  \"The poor fellow knows the state of Wonderland as well as I do,\" the Gryphon responds with a pitying glance at its friend, \"he often used to cry in his spare time, but now that he's found something serious to give him sorrow, he's doing all he can to distract himself.\"  The Mock Turtle hums to himself as the dancing continues, utterly enthralled.  \"It's for the best, don't you know!\" the Gryphon chuckles, \"no sense dwelling on such grim matters\"\n"
"You frown at the Gryphon's statement.  Sitting by idly is only going to help Gurathnaka in its conquest.  You warn the two creatures of the dangers the hungry shadows could pose if left unchecked.  The Mock Turtle covers his ears with two flippers and shakes his head, while the Gryphon scowls at your stories.  \"Such topics aren't polite, not one jot!\" the Gryphon scolds you.  The Mock Turtle nods with a whimper and chimes in after.  \"There's so much misery to be had, only let us ration it!  Let us sing of soup and schools, and join the lobsters in their quadrille!\""

"“怎麼樣？”獅鷲試探道，“從地面看，景色遠遠沒有那麼絕望。”你再次短暫地思考關於暗影和仙境的狀態，然後點點頭。獅鷲立即轉向返回地面，這一次向著開闊水域邊緣的一個安靜的潟湖俯衝過去。“來吧，看過這樣鬱悶的景象後，我知道什麼能讓你打起精神！我的朋友假海龜很會唱歌，更別提他的教養了！”你試著想像假海龜會長什麼樣子，但在獅鷲降落地點旁邊的生物與你的想像大相逕庭。假海龜大致像一隻海龜，但長著牛的頭。他坐在水邊，低頭看著水池，臉上帶著微笑，但眼淚卻從眼眶裡流了出來。“啊哈，如何唷！”獅鷲喊道，“舞蹈看得開心嗎？”\n"
"“看起來腳會痠痛。”假海龜點點頭低聲說。你猶豫地打了個招呼，他對你揮著腳蹼但沒看向你。他的注意力牢牢集中在面前的海浪上。你站在假海龜旁邊，看著水中，立刻看到了奇異的景象。上百種海洋生物在水面下以一種複雜而莊嚴的方式一同跳舞。假海龜隨著低沉的音樂節奏在海浪中拍打著腳蹼，仍然抽著鼻子，但享受沉浸於其中。\n"
"你不想太直白地問假海龜，於是你把獅鷲拉到一邊，悄聲地詢問為什麼這個生物會處於這種情緒狀態。“這個可憐的傢伙和我一樣知道仙境的狀態，”獅鷲回應道，用憐憫的目光看著他的朋友，“他平常沒事的時候就很愛哭，但現在有真正嚴重的事情讓他難過，所以就他就想盡辦法分散自己的注意力。”隨著舞蹈繼續，假海龜自顧自地哼唱著，完全沉迷在其中。“這樣最好，你不知道嗎！”獅鷲輕笑道，“沒道理去想那些可怕的事情！”\n"
"你對獅鷲的敘述表示不滿。袖手旁觀只會助長古拉斯納卡的侵略。你警告這兩個生物，如果不加以控制，飢餓的暗影會造成什麼危險。假海龜用兩隻腳蹼摀住耳朵搖了搖頭，而獅鷲則對你的故事皺起眉頭。“這種話題很沒禮貌，完全沒有！”獅鷲罵道。假海龜嗚咽著點點頭，然後開始唱道。“有這麼多的痛苦，就讓我們定量吧！讓我們歌頌湯和學校，加入龍蝦的方塊舞！”"

"The task of opposing Gurathnaka is too important for you to allow this apathy.  You go to great lengths to explain the threat of the shadows, ignoring their protests.  You spare no detail in the power, the relentlessness, and the wanton destruction the shadows are capable of.  The Gryphon brushes off each grim retelling, and the Mock Turtle shakes his head woefully, trying not to listen.  It is only when you begin talking about Arkham's destruction that the conversation seems to affect them.\n"
"You describe the chaos and madness that engulfed the city when last you saw it.  Each place and person you once held dear will be lost forever if you can't find a way to root Gurathnaka out of Alice's dreams.  The Mock Turtle bursts into a fresh cascade of tears while the Gryphon draws upward indignantly.  \"That is quite enough!\" he bellows, \"the poor fellow has delicate sensibilities, you know!  And now that you've-\"\n"
"\"No…\" the Mock Turtle blubbers, placing a flipper between the two of you, \"what's made me sad is that… is that I've been so intolerably selfish… we both have…\" the Gryphon's beak opens in shock and he stumbles over his words, but can't voice any protest to the statement.  \"To think that such sorrow was inside you… we simply must help.\"  The Gryphon regains his composure quickly, and though he still looks irritated at being made to look callous, he nods with a grumbling agreement."

"對抗古拉斯納卡的任務對你來說太重要了，你不能接受這種漠不關心的態度。你竭盡全力解釋暗影的威脅，無視他們的抗議。你鉅細靡遺地描述暗影的力量、無情和肆意破壞的能力。獅鷲對每次重複的嚴酷話語都置若罔聞，假海龜則悲哀地搖搖頭，盡量不去聽。當你開始談論阿卡姆的毀滅時，才打動了他們。\n"
"你描述了當你最後離開阿卡姆時吞沒這座城市的混亂和瘋狂。如果你無法找到將古拉斯納卡從愛麗絲夢境中根除的方法，你曾經珍視的每個地方和每個人都將永遠消逝。假海龜淚流滿面，而獅鷲則憤憤不平地抬起頭。“真是夠了！”他吼道，“這個可憐的傢伙感情很纖細，你知道的！現在你——”\n"
"“不……”假海龜哭著說道，把腳蹼攔在你們兩個中間，“我難過的是……是我太自私了……我們倆都是……”獅鷲的喙因震驚而張開，他結結巴巴，無法提出任何反駁。“沒想到你內心對此感到悲傷……我們必須提供幫助。”獅鷲很快恢復了鎮定，儘管他看起來還是對於被迫裝出冷酷無情的樣子感到惱怒，但他點點頭表示同意。"

"\"There's no need to be impertinent!\" the Gryphon snaps as it shelters the Mock Turtle under one wing, \"if you don't enjoy the ways that we handle our affairs, then you're welcome to exclude yourself from them!\"  The two delusional creatures return to watching the strange dance in the surf, refusing to acknowledging you any further.  With a resigned sigh, you turn away to rediscover the path, when you notice the daylight around you beginning to dim.\n"
"Wisps of shadow creep along the ground toward the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle, seeping inside them like water to a sponge.  You back away cautiously, hoping that they will continue to ignore you even as the shadows begin to corrupt them.  The tears that drip down the Mock Turtle's face darken until he cries dark liquid rivulets, while the Gryphon swells in size to match its overflowing pride.  Not wanting to risk another attack, you make a swift retreat from the darkening scene.\n"
"Your steps are suddenly halted as you feel a tug at your back, as if you had been leashed.  You look down and discover that your shadow stretches far behind you, as if tethered to the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle.  They turn to you, the one with a predatory eye and the other with trickling darkness on his.  \"You musn't go…\" the Mock Turtle moans with a distorted tone.  \"There is only sorrow out there… come and sit…\" the Gryphon echoes hollowly.  You struggle forward desperately as you feel yourself being reeled back toward them, until at last you jerk forward with a snap.  With the tether gone, you waste no time in making your escape."

"“沒必要無禮！”獅鷲將假海龜藏在一隻翅膀下，厲聲喝道。“如果你不喜歡我們處理自己事情的方式，那麼你可以不要多管閒事！”這兩個幻想生物回去觀賞海浪中奇怪的舞蹈，不想再理會你。你注意到周圍的日光開始變得黯淡，無奈地嘆了口氣，轉身重新尋找方向。\n"
"一縷縷影子沿著地面爬向獅鷲和假海龜，滲入他們體內，如同水滲入海綿般。你小心翼翼地後退，希望即使暗影開始腐蝕他們，也能繼續忽略你。假海龜臉上滴下的淚水變黑，他哭出的淚水形成黑色的小溪；而獅鷲的身軀膨脹，和牠的剛愎自用相符。你不想冒再次被攻擊的風險，迅速撤離了這個黑暗的景象。\n"
"你突然感覺背後被人拽了一下，好像被拴住了一樣，腳步停了下來。你往下看，發現你的影子在你身後長長地延展，彷彿被拴在了獅鷲和假海龜身上。牠們轉向你，一個眼神中充滿侵略性，另一個眼神中帶著一絲絲黑暗。“你別走……”假海龜用扭曲的語氣呻吟道。“外面只有悲傷……來這邊坐下……”獅鷲空洞地附和。你感到自己被捲向牠們，拼命地向前掙扎，直到最後向前猛撲，發出斷裂聲。栓索消失，你毫不猶豫立即逃走。"

"You feel more than a little drained from dealing with the two hodgepodge creatures as you set back on the journey through Wonderland.  You try to orient yourself from what you recall of the landscape from the back of the Gryphon, but it's all somehow wrong.  Once again, Wonderland seems to be shifting to keep you out - or at this point, in.\n"
"As you stare about the jumbled countryside, a single feather drifts into view, much like one from the Gryphon's own coat.  You look up to see hundreds of feathers floating on the breeze, slowly shifting into a long line that winds through the trees and over the rolling hills.  You have a feeling that you have Alice to thank once again for helping you navigate this madcap world.\n"
"You march forward, following the feather trail while it lasts, but your thoughts drift backward to the view from the Gryphon's back.  The balance between Wonderland's stability and Gurathnaka's advance is more precarious than you first imagined.  Questions and fears mix in your mind with each step forward.  Will the discoveries and insights you've gained be enough to beat back the shadows from Arkham?  Has Arkham already been reduced to irreversible ruin?  Or will you even be able to escape from Wonderland back into the real world at all?  Each question returns you the same answer: you won't know until you've tried.  With everything else in Wonderland so uncertain, the one thing you have to trust is your own decisions, come what may.  You press on, for better or worse, braced for the consequences."

"你回到仙境的旅程中，因為與這兩個混種生物打交道而感到筋疲力盡。你試圖回想你在獅鷲背上看到的風景來尋找方向，但一切天差地遠。仙境似乎再次移動，以將你排除在外——或者以當下的狀況來說，排除在內。\n"
"當你盯著被攪亂的田園時，一根羽毛飄入視野中，看起來與獅鷲的身上的羽毛一樣。你抬頭，看到數百根羽毛隨風飄揚，慢慢變成一條長長的線，蜿蜒穿過樹木，越過連綿起伏的山丘。你感覺到你得再次感謝愛麗絲的幫助，在這個瘋狂的世界指引你方向。\n"
"你繼續前進，在羽毛散去前沿著踪跡走，但你的思緒飄回到獅鷲背上的景色。仙境的穩定和古拉斯納卡的侵犯之間的平衡比你最初想像的更加岌岌可危。你向前邁出的每一步，腦海中都混雜著疑問和恐懼。你的發現和見解是否足以擊退阿卡姆的暗影？阿卡姆是否已經淪為不可逆轉的廢墟了？或甚至你還能從仙境回到現實世界嗎？每個問題的答案都相同：你不去試，就不會知道。仙境中的其他一切都如此不確定，因此無論發生什麼，你必須相信自己的決定。是好是壞你都得堅持下去，並準備好承受後果。"
