"It's a rare enough event to find any sort of hospitality in the vast expanse of Wonderland, so the sudden appearance of an English country manor gives you definite pause.  You advance quickly to the manor and shout a greeting to the two figures seated outside the main door.  Both are dressed in the fine uniforms of aristocratic servants, albeit one is a frog and one is a fish.  They glance at you lazily but do not rise from their seats, only sighing wistfully.\n"
"An awful commotion sounds dully through the door, although the two footmen seem not to hear it.  \"If you've more messages, you'll simply have to wait,\" the frog footman croaks at you, \"we've been waiting for weeks and we still can't get in.\"  You ask if the door is locked.  \"No,\" the fish footman burbles, \"but it's a footman's job to let people in, and if we're not inside, well…\"  The two footmen sigh a second time and go back to staring up at the sky dumbly.  You give the footmen a nominal thanks and open the door for yourself.\n"
"The inside of the manor is utterly chaotic.  Toppled furniture and display pieces litter the floors, and the wallpaper has been shredded systematically.  Each step brings you closer to the source of the noise, which you can only guess is a monster of some kind by the shrieking, clanging and scrambling you hear emitting from the kitchen.  Determined not to be caught by another of Wonderland's surprises, you ready yourself for a fight before you enter.\n"
"You burst through the kitchen door just in time to dodge a thrown piece of crockery.  A woman in the regal attire of a duchess stands beside her cook, both of them staring down an enormous shadowy boar, but both also looking more annoyed than frightened.  The Duchess scolds the monster severely and hurls pots and pans while her Cook does the bulk of the fighting with any utensils at hand.\n"
"\"You'll catch a beating yet!\" the Duchess shrieks as she grabs for more dishes.  The Cook hurls a butcher's cleaver at the boar, who swats it out of the air with a feral cry.  \"Pepper!  The air must be thick with pepper!\" the brutish noblewoman clangs two ladles together as she calls again and again for pepper.  The Cook staves off the monster with a carving knife as she joins in the calls for pepper.  As you prepare to take action, you spy a lone pepper grinder sitting atop the counter next to you."

"能在廣闊的仙境中受到任何形式的招待是一件很難得的事，因此當一座英式鄉村莊園突然出現，你毫不猶豫就停了下來。你快步走向莊園，向坐在大門外的兩個身影打了個招呼。他們兩個都穿著貴族僕人的精美制服，但一個是青蛙，一個是魚。他們懶洋洋地看了你一眼，沒有站起來，只是惆悵地嘆了口氣。\n"
"門的另一邊傳來一陣可怕的騷動，但兩個僕人似乎沒有聽到。“如果你也是來傳訊的，你有得等了。”蛙臉僕人對你嘓嘓地說道，“我們已經等了好幾個星期了，仍然無法進去。”你問他們門是不是鎖著。“沒有。”魚臉僕人汩汩地說道，“不過讓人進門是僕人的工作，如果我們不在裡面，那……”兩個僕人再次嘆了口氣，繼續看著天空發呆。你隨口謝過了僕人，然後自己打開了門。\n"
"莊園裡一片混亂。倒塌的家具和陳列品散落在地板上，牆紙也被有系統地撕碎了。你每走一步就更接近噪音的來源，通過你聽到的廚房裡傳出的尖叫聲、叮噹聲和爭吵聲，你只能猜測牠是某種怪物。你不想再被仙境的驚喜趁你不備，於是在進去之前做好了戰鬥準備。\n"
"你猛地衝進廚房的門，正好躲開一塊飛過去的陶片。一位身著華麗服飾的公爵夫人站在她的廚子旁邊，兩人都盯著一頭巨大的暗影野豬，但他們看起來比較像是惱怒而不是害怕。公爵夫人嚴厲地咒罵怪物，拿鍋碗瓢盆扔過去，而她的廚師用手邊的各種廚具負責進行大部分的戰鬥。\n"
"“遲早打中你！”公爵夫人尖叫著抓起更多的盤子。廚師向野豬扔了一把屠夫的大菜刀，野豬發出一聲野蠻的叫聲，將刀子從空中拍了下來。“胡椒！我們得在空氣中灑滿胡椒！”粗魯的貴婦人拿著兩個勺子互相敲打，不斷地要求將胡椒送過來。當她忙著催討胡椒時，廚師用一把切肉刀擋開了怪物。正當你準備採取行動時，你注意到你旁邊的櫃檯上有一個胡椒研磨器。"

"You grab the pepper grinder, half-questioning your own actions and half-assuring yourself that Wonderland has its own bizarre logic, even if you can't make heads or tails of it.  The handle whirls around easily, grinding the peppercorns and sending out a cloud of spice far denser than you expected.  Seconds later, the entire kitchen is blanketed with pepper.  You hold your nose, but the sneezes escape you all the same.  The shadowy boar joins you in wild sneezing while the Duchess and Cook, who are completely unaffected, cheer, still hurling dishes at the beast.  You can't make out a thing, but you can tell that the sneezes of the beast are growing more and more frenzied, until a single mighty expulsion clears the room of pepper, along with a fading shadow creature.\n"
"In the spot where the monster once stood, a baby with pig-like features lies in a bundle of cloth.  It wails loudly, still sneezing as the Duchess prances over to pick him back up.  \"There!  That will teach you to throw a tantrum just to annoy us!\"  You lower your weapons and scratch the back of your head in confusion, but the Duchess is completely delighted and the Cook has returned to preparing some unappealing soup.  \"Come now, sing with us, dear!  Speak roughly to your little boy, and beat him when he sneezes…\""

"你拿起胡椒研磨器，一方面懷疑自己的行為，一方面又覺得仙境有自己的詭異邏輯，即使是你也無法理解。手柄轉起來很輕鬆，胡椒粒被磨碎，冒出一團香料雲，比你預期的更稠密。幾秒鐘後，整個廚房都被胡椒粉覆蓋了。你摀住鼻子，但還是一樣狂打噴嚏。暗影般的野豬也和你一樣狂打噴嚏，而公爵夫人和廚師則完全不受影響，他們歡呼雀躍，繼續向野獸扔盤子。你什麼都看不清，但你知道怪物打的噴嚏越來越狂暴，直到一個特大噴嚏把房間裡的胡椒粉都清除，連同暗影生物也一起消失了。\n"
"在怪物原本站立的地方，躺著一個長得像豬一樣的嬰兒，裹在一捲布裡面。他大聲地哭，當公爵夫人跳過去把他抱起來時，他還在打噴嚏。“好了！這下你知道別只為了惹我們生氣而發脾氣了！”你放下武器，疑惑地抓了抓後腦勺，但公爵夫人非常高興，廚師則回去繼續準備一些看起來不怎麼好喝的湯。“來吧，和我們一起唱歌，親愛的！對你的小孩子要粗聲粗氣，只要他一打噴嚏就揍他……”"

"Your own means have carried you through the trials of Alice's dreams so far, and you see no reason to doubt your own abilities now.  You advance on the beast and combat it on your terms.  The screams from the Duchess and the Cook reach a deafening pitch, but you continue the fight in spite of them.  For minutes you probe and strike, wearing down the monster's energy gradually.  At last, the shadowy pig shrieks in panic and leaps out the kitchen window to escape your assault.\n"
"You turn back to the Duchess and her Cook, expecting a tiny bit of gratitude only to see them both frothing with fury and eyes wide with malice.  \"Brute!  Callous wretch!\" the Duchess bellows, gritting her teeth, \"you've savaged my boyish pig!  My piggish boy!\"  You can barely form a response as the two pelt you with any dishes and utensils they can reach.  From what little the Duchess and her Cook say coherently, you realize that the boar monster was once the Duchess' son, and was somehow transformed into the frightening creature you just drove away.  No explanation you give placates the crazed duo in the slightest.  You beat a hasty retreat to the relative safety of the manor's hallway as you dodge the debris.  The shouts and wails of the two madwomen echo after you, though neither makes any attempt to follow you out."

"到目前為止，你已經靠自己的方法度過了愛麗絲夢境中的各種考驗，現在沒有理由再懷疑自己的能力。你上前，按你的方法與怪獸戰鬥。公爵夫人和廚師的尖叫聲震耳欲聾，但你忽略他們繼續戰鬥。在幾分鐘之中你試探、攻擊，逐漸消耗怪物的體力。最後，那隻暗影般的豬驚恐地尖叫著，跳出廚房的窗戶以逃出你的攻擊。\n"
"你轉身面對公爵夫人和她的廚師，本以為會受到一點感激，結果卻看到他們倆都怒火中燒，眼裡充滿了惡意。“畜生！冷酷無情的壞蛋！”公爵夫人咬著牙吼道，“你把我的孩子豬給蹂躪了！我的豬孩子！”你完全無法做出回應，因為他們用手邊能拿到的任何盤子和器具丟向你。從公爵夫人和她的廚師的隻言片語裡，你意識到野豬怪物曾經是公爵夫人的兒子，而且不知何故變成了你剛剛趕走的可怕生物。你怎麼解釋都無法安撫這兩個瘋狂的人。你一邊躲避殘片，一邊匆忙地撤退到相對安全的莊園走廊。兩個瘋女人的哭聲和喊聲在你身後迴盪，但他們都沒有試圖追上你。"

"You exit the Duchess' manor to find the two footmen exactly where you left them.  They look to you with the same dull expressions as before.  \"Got what you came for?\" the frog footman asks drearily.  You're not really sure how to respond, but the fish footman doesn't give you a window to speak.  \"I doubt it,\" he bubbles, \"or else this message wouldn't have arrived.\"  He gestures to an enormous letter leaning up against the courtyard stones with your name written across the envelope.  You wonder for a moment who could possibly know that you would be at the Duchess' manor for such a brief span of time, and the answer soon occurs to you: Alice herself!\n"
"You had hoped that getting help in the form of a letter would have been more direct and clear than the other forms of assistance Alice had given you.  Unfortunately, you find the letter to be a jumbled mess of unrelated words.  Is Alice's ability to contact you really this limited?  You study the paper for several minutes wondering just what the message is trying to convey.  Some of the words you recognize based on your recent experiences, while others hint at challenges and dangers you have yet to brave.  You carefully discount the out of place words until the remaining ones begin to make sense as directions.  You double and triple check the letter, doubting your ability to make sense of this weirdness, but ultimately set off again through Wonderland if for no other reason than to leave the chaotic manor behind you."

"你離開公爵夫人的莊園，在與先前同樣的地方又遇到兩個僕人。他們看著你，表情和之前一樣呆滯。“完成你來的目的了嗎？”蛙臉僕人百般無聊地問道。你不確定該怎麼回答，但魚臉僕人沒給你說話的機會。“我覺得沒有。”他冒著泡泡說道，“否則這封信就不會送來了。”他指了靠在院子石頭上的一封巨大的信，信封上寫著你的名字。你好奇了一會兒，誰能在這麼短的時間內知道你在公爵夫人的莊園，然後很快就想到了答案：愛麗絲自己！\n"
"比起愛麗絲給你的其他形式的幫助，你原本期待收到信能獲得的幫助會更直接、更清楚。不幸的是，你發現信裡是一堆混亂不相關的字句。愛麗絲與你聯繫的能力真的如此受限嗎？你研究了幾分鐘的信紙，想知道它試圖傳達什麼信息。你根據最近的經歷認出其中一些字，其他地方則暗示了你尚未面對的挑戰和危險。你小心地剔除不適合的字，直到你開始能讀懂剩下句子裡的指示。你再三檢查了這封信，雖然不確定你理解這種怪異的能力是否可靠，但最終還是再次出發穿越仙境，就算沒別的理由，你也想離開這混亂的莊園。"
