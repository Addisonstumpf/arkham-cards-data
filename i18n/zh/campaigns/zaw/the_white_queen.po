msgid "Before you can leave the comfort of the room, you spot an odd undulation from a small central table.  Two items sit atop it: a chess board and a weathered notebook.  The board is strangely divided, one half orderly and pristine, the other cracked and warped.  The longer you look at the distorted side of the chess board, the more it seems to shift as if rearranging itself before your eyes.  Unnerved, you switch your focus to the notebook, only to find its contents written completely backwards.  You hold the booklet up to the looking-glass to reflect the image, and find a series of disturbing but intriguing passages concerning Alice's dreamland.  The margins of the book are filled with pencilled-in explanations of each that reference Alice, Gurathnaka, and shockingly, your own entrance into Wonderland.  You look around warily, wondering just who might be watching you even now.  The only certainty is that the answers lie somewhere beyond the door to the quiet room.  You brace yourself and head for the exit."
msgstr "在你離開舒適的房間之前，你發現中央小桌子上有一個奇怪的起伏。上面放著兩件物品：一個棋盤和一個褪色的筆記本。棋盤奇怪地分成兩邊，一半整齊如新，另一半彎曲裂開。你越是盯著棋盤扭曲的一邊，它愈發看起來好似在移動，就像在你眼前重新排列一般。你不安地將注意力轉移到筆記本上，卻發現它的內容完全反著寫。你將筆記本拿到鏡子前反射圖像，然後找到一系列關於愛麗絲仙境的段落，令人不安但又耐人尋味。這本書的頁邊空白處用鉛筆寫滿了對每段的解釋，提到了愛麗絲、古拉斯納卡，以及——令人震驚的——你自己進入了仙境。你警惕地環顧四周，懷疑現在說不定有誰在監視你。唯一能確定的是，答案就在這個安靜房間門外的某個地方。你振作起來，向出口走去。"

msgid "Any one investigator may choose to add Looking-Glass Book to their deck.  This card does not count toward that investigator's deck size."
msgstr "任意一位調查員可以選擇將鏡中書加入其牌組。這張卡牌不計入該調查員的卡牌張數。"

msgid "The placid countryside does little to ease your mind as you continue your endless trek.  The dangers of Alice's dream world are constant, but inconsistent.  Any creature, object, or bit of scenery could prove to be a maddened menace.  You wonder if the threats are the simple corruptions they seem to be, or if they were always a part of Alice's mind, always ready to erupt during a vulnerable moment.  Should you find your way out of this strange place, would Alice be any the better for it, to say nothing of Arkham?  Your mind focuses on this dazed line of thinking as the landscape transitions from wide orderly fields to a dense tangle of flowers."
msgstr "當你繼續無盡的跋涉時，寧靜的鄉村也無法讓你放鬆心神。愛麗絲夢中世界的危險持續不斷，但又變化無常。任何生物、物體或一段風景都可能被發現是瘋狂的威脅。你想知道這些威脅是不是如同它們表面上看起來的單純腐化，或者它們是否始終是愛麗絲心智的一部分，隨時準備在脆弱的時刻爆發。如果你找到這個陌生地方的出路，愛麗絲會不會好起來，甚至是阿卡姆？當你專注在這些茫然的思緒上時，景色從寬闊有序的田野轉變為茂密的花叢。"

"The path before you wends its way through a lush garden of flowering plants.  The many blossoms turn towards you as you pass, one by one, revealing cracked and distorted faces.  The flowers titter between each other with discordant chorus, watching and commenting as you walk.  They utter fatalistic words about you and your quest, and of the ever-growing hunger of Gurathnaka.  You hurry forward, doing your best to ignore the disturbing plants.\n"
"The overgrown garden finally opens around the base of a lone tree, under which an equally solitary figure paces.  The silhouette of a chess queen is unmistakable in the pale woman who mumbles to herself in a steady drone.  You approach, but she turns towards you with a distant smile before you even think to call for her attention.  \"Ah, you arrive at last!  I remembered that we would meet here.\"  You wrinkle your brow at the statement, only causing the queen to chuckle lightly.  \"And I recalled that expression of yours as well.  But it is no simple task, remembering the future.  Especially memories of such a dark and dismal future as yours.\"  She stares at you - almost as though staring through you - and you find her eyes pale and cloudy with a dark emptiness gnawing inward from the rims.  The White Queen's smile grows forlorn as she continues her stare.  \"Would you like to hear your future history?\""

"你面前的小路穿過鬱鬱蔥蔥開滿花朵的花園。當你經過時，許多花朵轉向你，一朵接著一朵，露出裂開、扭曲的臉。你走過去時，花朵發出不和諧的聲音，此起彼落地嗤笑著，對你品頭論足。對於你和你的任務，還有古拉斯納卡日益增長的飢餓，他們說著宿命無法改變的話語。你加速前進，盡力忽略那些令人不安的植物。\n"
"過度生長的花園終於在一棵孤樹的周圍有塊空地，一個同樣孤獨的人影在樹下踱步。很明顯是一個西洋棋王后的輪廓，一位面色蒼白的女人用穩定的嗡嗡聲喃喃自語。你接近她，但在你想到要引起她的注意之前，她就帶著悠悠的微笑轉向你。“啊，你終於到了！我記得我們會在這裡見面的。”聽到這句話，你皺了皺眉頭，但王后輕笑了一聲。“我也記得你的那個表情。但記住未來可不是一件簡單的事。尤其是像你這樣黑暗淒涼的未來的記憶。”她凝視著你——幾乎就像是看透了你——而你發現她的眼睛蒼白而混濁，黑暗的空虛侵蝕著她的眼眶。白棋王后繼續盯著你，笑容逐漸變得 。“你想聽聽你的未來史嗎？”"

msgid "The White Queen nods and opens her eyes wide, the cloudiness spewing forth like a plume of smoke.  The white haze envelops you in an instant, and for a silent moment you are lost in the fog.  The suspense fades slowly as the clouds collect into shapes, some familiar, others new and frightening.  The queen's voice echoes from all around you as you observe each of the figures, which morph and reform to reflect your thoughts.  \"Memories are strange things, you know.  Each person recalls them differently.\"  The nearest cloud takes on your own appearance, and the others drift towards it, forming a strange tableau.  The White Queen's voice continues, seeming more and more distant with each word.  \"There are those who say that the future is set in stone, but in truth, it is more like cement.  It takes some time to set.\""
msgstr "白棋王后點點頭，睜大雙眼，雲霧像一縷輕煙一樣噴湧而出。白色的霧靄瞬間將你籠罩，在無聲之中你一時迷失在霧裡。你懸著的心隨著雲霧匯聚形成各種形狀而慢慢放下，那些形狀有的熟悉、有的陌生而可怕。當你觀察那些形影時，王后的聲音在你周圍響起，這些形影變形重組，反映出你的思緒。“你知道，記憶是奇怪的東西。每個人回憶的方式都不一樣。”最近的一朵雲呈現出你自己的樣子，而其他的雲則向它飄去，形成了一個奇怪的畫面。白棋王后的聲音持續，但每一個字都顯得越來越遠離。“有人說未來像是石頭一樣不會改變，但實際上，它更像是水泥，需要一些時間才能凝固。”"

msgid "The White Queen nods solemnly and begins to tremble.  \"Dear me… those who cannot remember the future are condemned to repeat it…\"  The rejection seems to drain the life out of her, and she collapses to the grass, looking up with a hollow expression.  The blackness at the edges of the queen's eyes begins to flow inward, erupting up as her pupils are consumed.  The shadowy flow splashes up to surround you, whirling with hurricane speed.  You stand in anxious stillness as glimpses of Arkham, Wonderland, and other yet darker visions all flash through the torrent.  Which are real?  Which have already come to pass?"
msgstr "白棋王后臉色凝重地點點頭，然後開始顫抖。“我的天啊……那些不記得未來的人注定要重蹈覆轍……”你的拒絕似乎消耗了她的生命力，她癱倒在草地上，一臉空洞的抬起頭來。女王眼睛邊緣的黑色開始向內流動，當她的瞳孔被吞噬時爆發了出來。暗影噴濺而起，環繞著你，像颶風般以極快的速度旋轉著。你焦慮地靜止不動，看著阿卡姆、仙境和其他更黑暗的景象在洪流中閃過。哪些是真實的？而哪些已經發生了？"

msgid "Between blinks, the enveloping haze vanishes, and the White Queen along with it.  You still stand beneath the solitary tree, but the surrounding flowers have all wilted.  You hold your breath for a moment in unconscious reflex as you wait for any faint sound from the eerie blossoms, but without result.  Slowly, their fallen petals shift on the wind, forming larger shapes on the dry grass around you.  Lines and contours run together, and all at once the image clarifies into Alice's sleeping face.  It shifts as if breathing in, holding for a moment before blowing upward in a funneled gale.  The petals soar, swirling around and suspending in midair to form a line - a path!  You're unsure of what state Alice might be in, but it appears that she still has the ability to help guide you through her dream.  You follow the floating blossoms out of the bizarre garden without delay."
msgstr "眨眼之間，籠罩的霧霾就消失了，白棋王后也隨之消失。你還站在孤樹下，周圍的花兒都枯萎了。你反射性無意識地屏住呼吸了片刻，等待詭異的花朵發出任何微弱的聲音，但什麼都沒有。慢慢地，它們落下的花瓣隨風移動，在你周圍的乾草上排成一個很大的形狀。線條和輪廓融為一體，圖像一下子變得清晰，呈現出愛麗絲的睡臉。花瓣移動就像愛麗絲在吸氣，屏住了片刻，然後向上吹出一陣大風的漩渦。花瓣飛翔、盤旋；懸浮在半空中，形成一條線——一條路徑！你不確定愛麗絲現在的狀態如何，但看來她仍然有能力幫助引導你穿越她的夢境。你毫不遲疑地跟隨著漂浮的花朵走出奇異的花園。"
