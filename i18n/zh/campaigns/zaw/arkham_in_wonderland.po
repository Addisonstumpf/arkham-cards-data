msgid ""
"You enter the asylum and approach the receptionist, expecting a long and tedious chain of permissions, but are pleasantly surprised to find that Alice can be freely visited.  Ms. Liddell was quite cooperative upon her arrival and was granted a furnished room without restraints.  An orderly escorts you down one of the less unpleasant halls and into Alice's room.  She sits on the edge of the bed with her hands folded, and her head snaps up as you enter, apprehension plastered on her face.  Once you make it clear that you believe her story, however, Alice relaxes visibly, but her worried expression remains.\n"
"\"What you saw was a dream,\" she explains slowly, \"one from my childhood of a strange place called Wonderland.  How innocent it once was…\" her voice trails off and she begins to tremble.  \"When I was younger, I believed it to be a real place.  It all seemed so real to me then, and it was that belief that drew the attention of something dark.  A great and terrible creature that dwells in shadows and feeds on dreams.  But rather than devour Wonderland, the creature strengthened it… no, raised it like cattle.  Fattened it.  Wonderland became more vivid and real than I ever imagined it could be, and it grew beyond my ability to control.  Now, in recent months, my dreams have begun to manifest in the real world.\"\n"
"Her story is utterly fantastical, but you find yourself drawn in even more.  Alice continues with deep terror beginning to surface.  \"The creature is using me to bridge the gap of reality.  It wishes to merge the waking world with Wonderland in order to consume them both.  It began in my hometown in England, where the world began to unravel around me.  I fled, hoping to find a way to escape it, but it follows me no matter where I go.\"  Alice looks to you with exhausted desperation in her eyes.  \"And now that I cannot leave, it is only a matter of time until your own city of Arkham begins to unravel too.  You must find a way to stop this being, for your own sake if not for mine.  Please, you must find a way!\"\n"
"You reassure Alice to the best of your ability and depart the asylum, wondering how you can even begin this bizarre task.  As you exit, the familiar sight of Arkham's downtown district ripples before your eyes like a band of hot air in the summer, slowly beginning to distort.  Before you can act any further, a grinning mouth appears before you and a striped cat soon blossoms around it.  \"Welcome to Wonderland,\" it suddenly purrs, \"or perhaps you had better welcome Wonderland instead.  The longer you wait, the more of it there is… and the less of you there may be.  Gurathnaka is hungry, and it is very nearly supper time.\""

"你進入瘋人院，走向櫃台。原以為需要經過一連串冗長又繁瑣的申請，但你驚喜地發現可以自由探視愛麗絲。利德爾女士到了這裡之後非常合作，被送進一間沒有任何限制、有家具的房間。一位工作人員護送你穿過其中一個比較沒有這麼令人不安的大廳，進入愛麗絲的房間。她雙手交疊，坐在床邊。當你進門時，她猛然抬起頭，臉上充滿恐懼。在你明確地告訴她你相信她的故事之後，愛麗絲明顯放鬆了一些，但仍然一臉憂慮的表情。\n"
"“你看到的是我童年時期的一個夢境，”她慢慢地解釋道，“一個叫仙境的奇妙地方。它曾經是多麼純真……”她的聲音漸弱，並開始顫抖。“當我還小的時候，我相信仙境是一個真實的地方。那時對我來說一切都如此真實，而這種信念引起了某種黑暗事物的注意。那是一種巨大而可怕的生物，居住在陰影中，以夢境為食。但這個生物沒有將仙境吞噬，反而強化了它……不，應該說像家畜一樣飼養著仙境，將它養大。比起我自己的想像，仙境變得更加栩栩如生，更加真實，也漸漸不再受到我的控制。最近幾個月，我的夢境開始在現實世界中顯現。”\n"
"她的故事非常奇幻，但你發現自己更加地被故事吸引。愛麗絲深沉的恐懼開始浮現，她繼續說道，“這個生物正在利用我來橋接夢境與現實之間的間隙。它想要將清醒的世界和仙境融為一體，然後吞噬一切。從我在英國的家鄉開始，世界開始在我周圍崩解。我設法逃離，希望找到辦法擺脫它，但無論我到哪裡，它都跟著我。”愛麗絲看著你，眼中充滿了絕望。“現在我被關在這裡，我想，距離你的阿卡姆開始瓦解，也只是時間問題。你必須想辦法阻止這個存在，如果不是為了我，也是為了你自己。拜託，你必須找到方法！”\n"
"你向愛麗絲保證會盡你所能，然後離開了瘋人院，盤算著該從哪裡開始著手這個古怪的任務。當你離開時，熟悉的阿卡姆市中心的景像在你眼前泛起漣漪，慢慢開始扭曲，就像夏天的熱空氣。在採取進一步行動之前，一張咧著笑的嘴出現在你面前，緊接著一隻條紋貓在嘴的四周綻開。 “歡迎來到仙境，”牠突然發出呼嚕聲，“或者說你最好歡迎仙境的到來。耽擱的越久，它就越多……而你能做的就越少。古拉斯納卡餓了，很快就到晚飯時間了。”"

msgid "Set the following cards aside, out of play: Abandoned House, The White Rabbit, The Looking-Glass, Strange Refreshments, and Looking-Glass Book."
msgstr "將下列卡牌放在一邊，位於場外：廢棄荒屋、白兔、穿視鏡、奇怪的點心、鏡中書。"

msgid "Put the Arkham Asylum, Bank of Arkham, Independence Square, Newspaper Office, Curiositie Shoppe, and Train Station locations into play with their non-[[Wonderland]] sides revealed. Each investigator begins play at Arkham Asylum."
msgstr "將阿卡姆瘋人院、阿卡姆銀行、獨立廣場、報社、珍品店、火車站地點放置入場，非[[仙境]]面朝上。每位調查員從阿卡姆瘋人院開始遊戲。"

msgid "If any investigator resigned:"
msgstr "如果有任何調查員撤退："

msgid "As you wonder if this could already be the end, a deep pit carried by the city's shifting current draws alongside you.  You waste no time in taking the chance to escape the crushing cityscape, pulling yourself in and beginning to plummet down a seemingly endless shaft."
msgstr "正當你想著一切是否已經結束時，流動的城市潮流將一個深坑捲到你的身邊。你立即抓住機會逃離破碎的城市景觀，你把自己拉進坑裡，然後開始在這個似乎無窮無盡的豎井中墜落。"

msgid "As the city whirls around you, the strange mirror from Alice's house floats by, untouched by the roiling chaos.  You can see one of your comrades on the other side of the glass, reaching through the rippling surface out toward you.  You grab on for dear life, and are barely pulled inside to safety."
msgstr "隨著城市在你周圍旋轉，愛麗絲家中的怪異鏡子飄過你身邊，在翻騰的混亂中仍保持完整。透過玻璃，你可以在鏡子的另一側看到你的其中一個同伴，通過漣漪的鏡面向你伸出手。你抓住寶貴的活命機會，千鈞一髮地被拉到安全的鏡子內。"

msgid "As you travel through Alice's dreams, the fate of the mad realm of Wonderland also rests within your hands.  Each denizen that you aid or destroy has a direct effect on the stability of the dreams.  It may seem like a simple choice to cooperate with and save everyone you can, but the stronger Wonderland is, the more easily Gurathnaka can use it to strike out against the waking world.  Will you protect Wonderland while bolstering the shadows?  Or will you burn it away as you cauterize the wounds that the Eater of Dreams inflicted on Arkham?"
msgstr "當你在愛麗絲的夢境中旅行時，瘋狂國度仙境的命運也掌握在你的手中。你幫助或摧毀的每個居民都直接影響到夢境的穩定度。選擇與所有人合作並拯救他們似乎很簡單，但仙境越強大，古拉斯納卡就越容易利用它來攻擊現實世界。你會在保護仙境的同時也滋養了暗影嗎？還是在燒治夢境吞噬者對阿卡姆造成的傷害的同時也將仙境燒毀呢？"

msgid "How will Alice's psyche fare as you traverse her strange dreams?  Be aware of anything that could help preserve her sanity."
msgstr "當你穿越愛麗絲奇怪的夢境時，她的精神狀態能維持嗎？留意任何可以幫助她保持理智的事情。"

msgid "the investigators went down the rabbit hole."
msgstr "如果調查員掉進了兔子洞。"

msgid "the investigators went through the looking glass."
msgstr "如果調查員穿過了鏡子。"

msgid "The city flows like an ocean, sweeping you away and nearly swallowing you in the chaotic mass.  You are battered and crushed between bricks and cobble-stones as the landscape swirls around and around, folding in on itself with each rotation."
msgstr "城市像海洋一樣流動，將你捲入其中，你幾乎被吞沒在混亂的物質中。地上景物一圈又一圈地捲起，每次旋轉都與自己折疊，而你在其中被磚塊和鵝卵石擊打、擠壓。"

"The terror of diving into the pit quickly fades to apprehension, and soon curiosity.  The counted seconds stretch to minutes, though easily tracked by the constant ticking of the clocks lining the walls of the rabbit hole.  Just as you wonder if you might very well fall infinitely, the ground suddenly rises below you, and you land with surprisingly little impact.  Rising to your feet, you spy the fleeting form of the white rabbit once again sprinting down a long corridor before you.  With no way back up, and Arkham likely in shambles anyhow, you have little choice but to continue following the strange creature.\n"
"The corridors wind endlessly, diverging and converging like the tunnels of an ant colony.  Doors fill every part of the walls, no two alike in shape, size, or style.  Your curiosity is stifled, however, as you find each solidly locked.  With no alternative but to continue down the hallway, you soldier onward in pursuit of the rabbit."

"在坑中墜落的恐懼感很快就轉變為忐忑，不久就變成了好奇。兔子洞壁上的時鐘不斷滴答作響，很容易計算時間，計數從幾秒一直延長到了幾分鐘。就在你猜想是否自己會無窮無盡地墜落時，地面突然在下方出現，你落地時很驚訝地只受到微小的衝擊。你站起身來，再次看到白兔稍縱即逝的身影衝向你面前的一條長廊。你沒有辦法回去上面，而且阿卡姆很可能一片混亂，別無選擇，只能繼續跟隨這個奇怪的生物。\n"
"走廊不斷蜿蜒曲折，像螞蟻的隧道一樣分開又匯合。整個牆壁上滿滿的都是門，每扇門的形狀、大小或風格都完全不相同。但你發現所有的門都鎖得牢牢的，扼殺了你的好奇心。除了繼續沿著走廊走，沒有別的選擇，你鼓起勇氣繼續追逐兔子。"

msgid "The sound of Arkham's collapse vanishes completely as you cross through the glass.  You glance backwards to see only blackness with splashes of color and shapes, churning slowly.  You're not sure if you can return the way you came, or if you even want to, with the way that the city was being torn apart.  You stand transfixed until the heat and crackle of the fire beneath the mantle rouse your thoughts.  This is no time to be waiting and wondering.  You must find what lies beyond the mirror."
msgstr "當你一穿過鏡子，阿卡姆塌毀的聲音就完全消失了。你向後一看，只看到黑色上面濺著一些色彩和形狀，緩緩地攪動著。你不確定你是否可以用同樣的方式回去，或者甚至你是否還想回到被那樣子撕裂的城市。你呆滯地站在那裡，直到布幔下的熱氣和劈啪聲喚回你的思緒。現在不是等待和考慮的時候。你必須探索鏡子之外的世界。"

"\"I do hope you'll forgive our cold hospitality.  A welcoming committee simply couldn't be arranged.\"  The Cheshire Cat appears before you, its grin ever constant.  For the first time since the danger started, you at last have a moment to chastise the cat.  Appearing and disappearing, helping you and hindering you, it only proves to muddle your understanding of the bizarre events.  \"I'm afraid I can't help it,\" the cat purrs serenely, \"my nature is madness.  Everyone is mad in Wonderland, you see.  You yourself are beginning to go mad, or else you wouldn't be here.\"  You'd like to refute the cat, but you feel as if you are already walking a path of madness in trying to save Arkham from these bizarre occurrences.\n"
"The Cheshire Cat orbits you slowly, observing you from all angles as it speaks.  \"Still, I am a creature of Wonderland, and it is in my best interests to preserve my home, just as it is in your best interests to preserve yours.  Quizzically, Alice has entrusted you with both.\"  The cat rises up to stare you in the eye at an uncomfortably close distance.  \"You'll carry on, of course, but how will you carry on?  Like a surgeon, cutting out the infection?\" Its head detaches to punctuate the point.  \"Or like a miner, blasting all to oblivion?\"  The cat's body scatters as if blown apart, but the head remains eerily in place.  \"Whether you trim gently or tear it out by the roots, any future is preferable to being consumed utterly.  Alice would agree, I should think.  Assuming she is still lucid after being made into a gateway, of course.\"\n"
"The cat's head fades away, leaving only its grin behind once more.  You have a lot to consider and a long road ahead."

"“我希望你能原諒我們的冷淡招待，我們完全無法籌組歡迎委員會。”柴郡貓出現在你面前，牠咧嘴的笑容一如既往。自從危機開始以來，你終於能夠有機會斥責這隻貓。牠擅自出現又消失，幫助又阻礙你，只會讓你對詭異事件的理解更加困惑。“恐怕我情不自禁，”貓平靜地咕噥道，“我天生是瘋的。你知道，仙境裡每個人都是瘋的。你自己也開始瘋了，否則你就不會在這裡了。”你想反駁這隻貓，但你覺得自己試圖從這些離奇的事件中拯救阿卡姆，好像也已經走上了一條瘋狂的道路。\n"
"柴郡貓緩緩地繞著你轉，一邊從各個角度觀察你一邊說話。“不過，我是仙境裡的生物，我想保護我的家園，就像你想保護你的家園一樣。奇怪的是，愛麗絲將這兩件事情都託付給了你。”貓站起來盯著你的眼睛，距離太近了。“當然，你會去做，但你該如何進行？像外科醫生一樣，切除感染源？”牠的頭跟身體分離，以強調牠的論點。“還是像礦工一樣，把一切都炸成灰燼？”貓的身體四散，像是被炸開了一樣，但牠的頭卻詭異地保持在原地。“不管你想輕輕地修剪，還是連根拔起，任何未來都比完全被吞噬掉好。我想愛麗絲會同意的。當然，假如她被當成聯結後還能保持清醒的話。”\n"
"貓的頭開始褪色，再次只剩下牠咧著笑的嘴。而你有很多事情要考慮、還有很長的路要走。"
