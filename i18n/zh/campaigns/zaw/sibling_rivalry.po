"The places in Wonderland where the fields and trees meet tend to spark the greatest suspicion in you.  The illusion of safety in the wide plains makes the darkened forests look all the more sinister.  Shadows flit around every fallen log and bed of moss, making each step forward a nervous one.  Where will Gurathnaka's hungry minions strike from this time?  As if to answer your question, a pair of dark claws extend from a rotted stump, but before you can beat them back, a shaking sound echoes from within the woods, and the shadows retreat.  Curiosity strikes you at the swift result, and you head a little deeper into the woods to find the source of the noise.\n"
"Even after what you've seen in Wonderland, the sight that greets you seems far-fetched.  Two rotund figures of indeterminate age stand in a clearing, fighting back and forth over a small object.  It takes a moment of observation before it occurs to you that the two look exactly like Tweedledum and Tweedledee from the old nursery rhyme.  They're currently tussling with each other over a toy rattle, which you quickly identify as the source of the strange noise from before.  You look to the edges of the clearing and confirm that each wild shake of the rattle causes the creeping shadows to shrink away.  Strange as it seems, it may help your mission to get that rattle.\n"
"You step closer to the two and try to interject, but the twins look to you indignantly.  \"It's rude to interrupt!\" Tweedledee snaps at you with a sneer.  \"Contrariwise, it's polite to say nothing at all!\" Tweedledum chimes in.  They ignore your attempts at reasoning and bargaining as they return to their tug-of-war.  \"It's my rattle and I shan't let you take it!\" Tweedledum grunts at his brother.  \"You've had your fun!  It's my turn now!\" Tweedledee spits back.  The two pull on the rattle until a wooden crack echoes out, and each collapses back with half of it.  \"You broke it!\" Tweedledum cries out, though his brother shakes his head and sneers \"Didn't!\"  The pair storm off before you can intervene or mediate, shouting threats of war at each other.\n"
"You sigh in irritation.  At first you consider just snatching the pieces of the rattle away from them, but your plan is quickly stifled by the sudden appearance of two massive armies of figures.  One battalion is made of living playing cards, and the other of living chess pieces, each siding with one of the Tweedles, who are busy strapping household objects to themselves for protection.  The Cheshire Cat appears between you with the same telltale grin, but a roll of his eyes.  \"Tweedledum and Tweedledee agreed to have a battle.  Surely you know the rest,\" it purrs as the combatants take places across a small wooded valley from each other.  Once again, you've been caught up in the nonsense of Wonderland's strange citizens.  Still, if at all possible, you've got to get your hands on that rattle."

"仙境中田野和樹木的交界往往是最讓你起疑的地方。廣闊平原上安全的錯覺讓漆黑的森林顯得更加險惡。暗影在每個倒下的樹幹和苔蘚叢上掠過，踏出的每一步都令人緊張萬分。古拉斯納卡的飢餓爪牙們這次將從何處襲擊？彷彿是在回答你的問題，一雙漆黑的爪子從一根腐爛的樹樁上伸出來，但還沒等你將它們擊退，樹林中就傳來一陣顫抖的聲音，暗影隨之退去。你很快就按捺不住好奇心，向樹林深處走去，尋找噪音的來源。\n"
"即使在你已在仙境中見聞了許多，你面前的景像也令你難以置信。兩個看不出年齡的圓滾滾的身影站在一片空地上，為了一個小東西有來有往地打架。你花了一點時間觀察，才發現這兩個人看起來與古老童謠中的崔德頓和崔德迪完全一樣。他們正在為了一個玩具撥浪鼓爭吵，你很快就發現這就是之前奇怪噪音的來源。你望向空地的邊緣，發現每當撥浪鼓狂亂的搖動時，蔓延的暗影都會縮小。雖然看似奇怪，但取得撥浪鼓可能對你的任務會有幫助。\n"
"你靠近兩人並試圖插話，但雙胞胎憤怒地看著你。“打斷別人是不禮貌的！”崔德迪衝著你冷笑。“反之，什麼都不說才是禮貌的！”崔德頓附和道。他們無視你的嘗試勸說和討價還價，回到他們的拉鋸戰裡。“這是我的撥浪鼓，我不會讓你拿走的！”崔德頓對他的兄弟咕噥道。“你已經玩過了！現在輪到我了！”崔德迪回嘴道。兩人拉扯著撥浪鼓，直到響起一道木頭裂開的聲音，然後雙方各拿著半個撥浪鼓倒在地上。“你把它弄壞了！”崔德頓大叫，而他的兄弟搖著頭譏笑道：“才怪！”在你能介入或調解之前，這對雙胞胎就暴走了，互相喊著威脅要大戰。\n"
"你惱怒地嘆了口氣。本來你考慮直接從他們手中搶走撥浪鼓的碎片，但你的計劃很快就被突然出現的兩支龐大的軍隊所阻止。一支軍隊由會動的撲克牌組成，另一支由會動的西洋棋子組成，各自支持其中一個崔德兄弟，而崔德兄弟正忙著將各種家用物品綁在自己身上作為防護。柴郡貓出現在你們中間，帶著同樣的咧笑，但翻著白眼。“崔德頓和崔德迪決定要進行一場戰役。剩下的你都知道。”當戰鬥人員隔著一個樹木繁茂的小山谷彼此對峙時，它發出呼嚕聲。再一次，你被捲入了仙境奇怪居民的荒謬事件之中。不過，你還是得盡可能地拿到那個撥浪鼓。"

You pause a short distance away to recover, and scarcely a minute passes before the din of the battle ceases abruptly.  You hesitantly and painfully make your way back to the edge of the basin, only to find that the cards and chess pieces have departed.  Lying crumpled in the center of the valley are the corpses of Tweedledum and Tweedledee, hands at each others' throats.  You swallow grimly and try to recover the rattle pieces from their bodies, but you find them battered beyond recognition.  An unfortunate setback, but one you will have to live with."
msgstr "戰鬥升級為大戰。軍隊從山坡上奔湧下來在中間互相衝撞，你幾乎無法逃出山谷。你在不遠處停下來恢復，不到一分鐘，戰鬥的喧囂就突然停止了。你遲疑又痛苦地回到谷地邊緣，卻發現撲克牌和棋子們都已經離開。崔德頓和崔德迪的屍體慘兮兮地躺在山谷中央，雙手互相掐著對方的喉嚨。你面無表情地嚥了一口口水，試著從他們身上取得撥浪鼓的碎片，但你發現碎片已被摧殘得面目全非。這是個不幸的挫折，但你必須接受這個現實。"

msgid "The cards and chess pieces immediately stop their fighting, some mid-swing as one of the Tweedles drops dead on the battlefield.  You approach with a disappointed sigh, intending to retrieve his piece of the rattle, only to be interrupted by the approach of his brother.  \"He's… he's dead!  That'll teach him to…\" his lip quivers and he swallows a whimper.  \"This battle wasn't my fault!  Twasn't at all!\"  The living twin takes out his piece of the rattle and clutches it in one fist as he fights tears.  \"It wasn't fair!  I only wanted the rattle, and he was being greedy!\"  His eyes snap to you as you loom over his brother's body, and his brow sinks in fury.  \"You want to take the rattle from me too!  You shan't!\"  The cards and chess pieces crowd around the Tweedles, raising their weapons towards you as you weigh your decisions carefully."
msgstr "當其中一個崔德兄弟倒在戰場上死去時，紙牌和棋子們立即停止了戰鬥，有的還揮舞到一半。你失望的嘆著氣走過去，打算取回他的撥浪鼓，他的兄弟卻靠近打斷你。“他……他死了！這個教訓給他……”他的嘴唇顫抖著，吞下了一聲嗚咽。“這場戰鬥不是我的錯！肯定不是！”活下來的雙胞胎拿出他那一半的撥浪鼓，手上握拳緊緊抓住它，一邊強忍著淚水。“不公平！我只是想要撥浪鼓，是他太貪心了！”當你在他兄弟的屍體上找東西時，他突然眼睛盯著你，眉毛憤怒地沉了下來。“你也想從我這裡奪走撥浪鼓！不行！”你小心地思考你的決定，而紙牌和棋子聚集在崔德兄弟周圍，朝著你舉起武器。"

msgid "The threat of the cards and chess pieces isn't enough to dissuade you from the rattle.  You won't walk away from this battle empty-handed, after all this.  Weapons out, you charge at the remaining Tweedle, who hollers at his soldiers to attack.  He's nowhere near a match for you, but the soldiers beat and stab you severely amid your assault.  As your attack hits home and the second Tweedle falls dead at your feet, the soldiers freeze in their tracks, their battle finally over with the deaths of both commanders."
msgstr "紙牌和棋子的威脅不足以嚇阻你取得撥浪鼓。在這一切之後，你可不會空手而歸。你掏出武器，衝向剩下的崔德兄弟，而他大喊著命令他的士兵攻擊。他遠不是你的對手，但士兵們趁你攻擊時重重地擊打和刺傷了你。隨著你的攻擊打中要害，第二個崔德兄弟倒在你腳下時，士兵們僵住了腳步，他們的戰鬥最終以兩名指揮官的死亡告終。"

msgid "After all the mayhem of the Tweedles' battle, you decide it's better to cut your losses.  You back away from the corpse with your hands raised and allow his brother to rush in.  He greedily seizes the other half of the broken rattle and raises it triumphantly for the briefest moment before collapsing down to his seat.  The surviving Tweedle sits slumped by the body of his brother, bawling pitifully and shaking the broken toy as you make your solemn departure.  Such an awful state of affairs you'd hoped never to be a party to."
msgstr "在崔德兄弟之戰造成的所有混亂之後，你決定最好該停損了。你舉起雙手從屍體旁退開，讓他的兄弟衝過去。他貪婪地抓住了破碎撥浪鼓的另一半，得意洋洋地舉了一會兒，然後坐倒在地上。活著的崔德兄弟癱坐在他兄弟的屍體旁，可憐地一邊嚎啕大哭，一邊搖晃著壞掉的玩具，而你嚴肅地離開。如此糟糕的事態，你真希望沒被捲入其中。"

"You assemble the pieces of the rattle as quickly as you can while the monstrous crow wheels upward.  Would the rattle work as it did before it was broken?  You cross the fingers of your free hand and shake the rattle wildly as the shadowy bird swoops down at you.  It dives within inches of your face, and you nearly cringe, but the shadows flow around you, and the crow feathers drift harmlessly down to the ground as the beast disperses.\n"
"A pair of terrified whimpers directs your attention to Tweedledum and Tweedledee hugging each other fearfully as they stare in your direction.  \"Tain't natural, not nohow!\" they mewl, \"and all for a rattle…\"  They look to the rattle and cringe in fear, the very sight of it now reminding them of the crow.  They retreat a short distance away from you and talk amongst themselves for a moment.  Finally, the duo shakes hands and walks away with arms over each others' shoulders.  It seems unlikely, but perhaps you've scared some sense into them after all."

"巨大的烏鴉向上盤旋，你盡快地將撥浪鼓的碎片組裝起來。撥浪鼓的效果會像它壞掉之前那樣嗎？當那隻暗影之鳥向你俯衝時，你瘋狂地搖晃著撥浪鼓，另一隻空出來的手則祈求著好運。它的俯衝距離你的臉只有幾寸，你幾乎要畏縮起來。但隨著烏鴉的消散，暗影在你周圍流過，而烏鴉的羽毛無害地飄落到地上。\n"
"你的注意力被兩個驚恐的嗚咽聲吸引了，崔德頓和崔德迪盯著你的方向，害怕地互相抱著對方。 “這太不自然了，肯定絕不！”他們啜泣著，“只是為了一個撥浪鼓……”他們看著撥浪鼓，在恐懼中畏縮著，現在一看到撥浪鼓就讓他們想起了烏鴉。他們逃到離你沒有很遠的地方，彼此交談了一會兒。最後，二人握了握手，雙臂搭在彼此的肩膀上離開了。儘管不太可能，但也許你真的把他們嚇到恢復理智了。"

msgid "The rattle seems so ordinary, and yet you can feel some strange power within it.  It's a simple feeling, that a childish object could banish your fears and nightmares, but in Alice's dreams, perhaps there's some tangible truth to it.  Any possible weapon against the shadows is worth keeping a hold of, at any rate."
msgstr "撥浪鼓看似平凡，但你卻能感覺到其中有某種奇異的力量。這是一種單純的感覺，孩童的用具可以消除恐懼和惡夢；但在愛麗絲的夢境中，也許對有形的東西也能成立。無論如何，任何可以對付暗影的武器都值得拿到手。"
