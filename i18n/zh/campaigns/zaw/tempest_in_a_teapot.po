msgid ""
"The scattered paths of Wonderland offer no more safety or direction than its wilderness.  Whether the roads have always been tangled or whether Gurathnaka has twisted the dream land is unclear, but you keep up your trek regardless.  At a crossroad at the edge of a large patch forest, you stop to consider carefully, only for the Cheshire Cat to appear once more on a branch above you.  \"I remember this spot well,\" he purrs, sweeping both his front paws to either side, \"In that direction lives a Hare, and in the other lives a Hatter, both quite mad.\"  You give an exasperated sigh.  Most of the citizens of Wonderland have been more than a little unhinged, but for the cat to make a note of these two speaks to just how crazy they might be.  \"They are likely to be at the hare's house, as it is nearly tea time.  Then again, it is always nearly tea time with those three.\"  The cat fades away once more before you can get any more details.  You puzzle over the cat's words carefully.  Tea for three, but he only mentioned the hare and hatter.  You expect it was the cat's way of guiding you to the third figure while maintaining its cryptic madness.\n"
"You follow the weaving road toward the Hare's house, unsure of what to expect.  The path veers off into the woods, but very quickly dead ends in a small cottage.  The house looks uninhabited, but the sounds of laughter and clinking of china lead you around to a side garden.  A long table stretches out across much of the small garden, stacked high with tea cups and pots, bread and butter, and all other manner of refreshments.  The Hare and the Hatter sit across from one another, conversing loudly, though their words seem like complete gibberish to you.  In the center of the table, a Dormouse peeks out of a teapot, disheveled and looking quite exhausted.  He looks up with drooping eyelids as you approach, looking as though he had something important to say but quite forgot it.  Before you can greet each other, the Dormouse's eyes close and he sinks back into the teapot with a long sigh.\n"
"All at once, as the Dormouse sinks to sleep, shadows sweep in from the edges of the garden.  You leap into one of the chairs, only for the Hare and Hatter to turn their attention to you with offended expressions.  \"No room, no room!\" they chide, seemingly oblivious to the encroaching darkness.  You brace for the wave of shadows, but instead, you feel a flutter in your stomach as your chair rises into the air.  The table and other chairs follow in short order, rising just above the consuming darkness.  \"It's very rude to sit down without being invited, you know!\" the Hare continues.  The Hatter nods in agreement before chiming in.  \"But since you're here, try to guess this riddle, if you can!\"  You nod half-heartedly at the tea party hosts as you begin to figure your way out of this dilemma."

"仙境裡四散的道路沒有比仙境的荒野更安全或更有方向感。你不清楚是否這些路本來就複雜糾結，還是古拉斯納卡扭曲了夢境世界，但無論如何，你都得繼續你的旅程。在一大片森林的邊緣，你停在一個十字路口仔細思考，但柴郡貓再次出現在你上方的樹枝上。“這個地方我記得很清楚，”牠咕囔著，將兩隻前爪掃向兩邊，“那邊住著一隻三月兔，另一邊住著一位帽匠，他們兩個都很瘋。”你厭煩地嘆了口氣。大多數的仙境居民都有些精神不正常，但貓特別提到這兩位，說明了他們可能更嚴重。“他們大概在三月兔的家，因為下午茶時間快到了。話說回來，對這三位來說，下午茶時間總是快到了。”這隻貓在你能搞清楚更多細節之前就再次消失了。你仔細琢磨貓的話。有三位在喝下午茶，但牠只提到了兔子和帽匠。你認為這是貓在保持神秘又瘋狂的同時，指引你注意到第三個角色的方式。\n"
"你沿著交織的道路前往三月兔的家，感到前途未卜。小路轉入樹林，但很快就在一個小屋前到達盡頭。屋子看起來沒人住，但笑聲和瓷器相碰的聲音引領你來到一個側花園。一張長桌佔據了小花園的大部分空間，上面堆滿了茶杯和茶壺、麵包和奶油，還有各種各樣的點心。三月兔和帽匠面對面坐著，大聲交談，他們說的話在你聽來完全是胡言亂語。在桌子中央有一隻睡鼠從茶壺裡探出頭來，看上去衣著不整又很疲憊。當你走近時，他昏昏欲睡地抬起頭，看起來好像是有重要的事情要說，但忘了是什麼。你還沒來得及跟他打招呼，睡鼠就閉上了眼睛，一邊嘆了口長氣，一邊沉入茶壺中。\n"
"就在睡鼠睡著沉下去的同時，黑影突然從花園的邊緣掃了進來。你跳上其中一張椅子，但只見兔子和帽匠帶著被冒犯的表情，將注意力轉向你。“沒位置，沒位置！”他們抱怨著，似乎沒有察覺到正在侵入的黑暗。你準備要承受暗影來襲，但取而代之的是，你的椅子浮了起來，使你的胃一陣翻攪。餐桌和其他椅子緊隨其後，也浮到吞噬一切的黑影上方。“你知道，沒受到邀請就坐下來是很不禮貌的！”三月兔繼續道。帽匠點頭表示同意，接著插話。“不過既然你已經來了，如果可以的話，猜猜看這個謎語！”你心不在焉地對茶會主人點了點頭，開始想辦法脫離這個困境。"

"For this scenario, most locations are much smaller than average.  Only one investigator or enemy can occupy a [[Chair]] location at once.  Investigators cannot enter [[Chair]] locations that are occupied by another investigator or enemy.  Investigators at [[Chair]] locations may swap positions with other investigators and enemies using the abilities listed below.  Swapping positions occurs simultaneously in all cases and does not provoke attacks of opportunity.\n"
"Because of these restrictions, investigators at [[Chair]] locations are considered to be engaged with each non-aloof enemy at each connecting [[Chair]] location.  Players may engage, attack, evade, parley, and activate effects as if those enemies were at their location.  Enemies may also attack and activate effects as if they were at the engaged investigators' locations.  After an enemy enters a [[Chair]] location, it engages all investigators at all connecting [[Chair]] locations.  Failed attacks against enemies engaged with multiple investigators do not deal damage to other investigators.  If an investigator moves while engaged with any amount of enemies at [[Chair]] locations, those enemies make attacks of opportunity normally, but do not move after attacking.  If an investigator or enemy would move to an investigator's location via a card effect, move them to the nearest empty [[Chair]] location instead.\n"
"When an enemy would move between two [[Chair]] locations, but its path is blocked by another enemy or an investigator who did not trigger this movement, swap its position with that other enemy or investigator.  Swapping positions occurs simultaneously in all cases and does not provoke attacks of opportunity.\n"
"Investigators at [[Chair]] locations may commit cards to skill tests performed by investigators at connecting [[Chair]] locations.  Card effects or abilities that target or trigger from investigators or enemies at your location may target investigators or enemies at a connecting [[Chair]] locations instead.  Card effects or abilities that target or trigger from investigators or enemies at connecting or other locations are unchanged.  Investigators at [[Chair]] locations may interact with cards in the threat areas of investigators at connecting [[Chair]] locations.\n"
"Investigators may take the following two actions at any time during the scenario:\n"
"[action] If you are at a [[Chair]] location: <b>Move</b>.  Swap positions with an investigator at a connecting [[Chair]] location.  This action does not provoke attacks of opportunity for the other investigator.\n"
"[action] If you are at a [[Chair]] location: <b>Parley</b>.  Swap positions with an enemy at a connecting [[Chair]] location."

Just when it seems certain that the end is upon you, the shadows freeze.  You are suspended for a moment before they recede suddenly, sliding off of you like water.  The darkness evaporates, leaving you in one of the tea party chairs once more.  The Hare and Hatter are nowhere to be seen, no trace of them remaining.  Mere feet away, the shadows condense around the Dormouse who is fast asleep once more, but whimpering and kicking as his nightmares overwhelm him.  There is no chance to save the poor creature, and you retreat from the garden before you are caught up in the shadows' embrace again."

"\"An excellent riddle!  Let's have another!\"  The exclamation snaps you out of your thoughts, and you turn to see the Hare and Hatter still seated around the table, sipping tea and smiling congenially.  You keep your distance, remembering how they behaved during the earlier chaos, but they act as though nothing had happened.  \"Come now, a bright guest like you can surely think of a riddle we haven't heard before!\" the Hare invites, bounding over to escort you to a closer chair.  Your thoughts jumble and your words stumble, but your recent experience inspires a question.  When can you be in the dark and in the light at the same time?  The duo scratch their chins and tap their spoons idly, spending several seconds in thought.  Finally, the Hare draws upward and raises a finger.  \"When it's day out, but you've no idea what's going on!\" he proudly proclaims.\n"
"\"No, no!  It's quite the opposite!\" the Hatter scoffs, \"When you know exactly what is going on, but it's dark all around!  After all, it was pitch black only a moment ago and we knew precisely what happened!\"  You raise an eyebrow at the suggestion that they were aware of the danger the entire time.  The Hatter pulls you closer and lowers his voice to a whisper that's somehow louder than his speaking voice.  \"Everyone is mad here, you know.  The things that make sense, well, those belong in Alice's world.  And the shadows are rather picky.  Why, poor Dormy here started making sense and they went after him just like that!\"  You press the two mad partygoers further, and to your surprise, they divulge plenty of details about Gurathnaka and his brood.\n"
"The Dormouse gives a long sigh and smiles faintly as he continues waking up fully.  \"They may be mad, but friends are friends.  I'm quite surprised - and happy, mind you - that you didn't give them a thrashing for their trouble.\""

"“真是個絕妙的謎語！讓我們再猜一個吧！”驚嘆聲把你從思緒中拉了回來，你轉身看到三月兔和帽匠仍然坐在桌子旁，喝著茶，愉悅地笑著。你想起他們在先前混亂中的行為舉止，和他們保持距離，但他們表現得好像什麼事都沒發生過。“來吧，像你這樣聰明的客人，一定能想到一個我們沒聽過的謎語！”三月兔邀請道，跳過來陪同你坐到更近的椅子上。你的思緒混亂，言語磕磕絆絆，但你最新的經歷給了你謎語的靈感。你什麼時候可以同時在黑暗和光明中？兩位搔著下巴，徒然地敲打著勺子，思考了幾秒。終於，三月兔抬起頭並舉起一根手指。“在白天，但你被蒙在鼓裡時！”他自豪地答道。\n"
"“不，不！恰恰相反！”帽匠嗤之以鼻，“當你心中明白，但周圍一片黑暗的時候！畢竟，剛才還是一片漆黑，但我們都很清楚地知道發生了什麼！”你揚起了眉毛，發現他們一直都有意識到危險。帽匠把你拉近，壓低聲音耳語，但不知怎地比他平常說話的聲音更大聲。“你知道，這裡的每個人都是瘋的。那些有道理的事情，嗯……那些屬於愛麗絲的世界。而暗影相當挑剔。因為，可憐的鼠仔開始理解什麼的時候，它們就像那樣盯上了他！”你向這兩位瘋狂的茶會常客進一步詢問，令你驚訝的是，他們透漏了很多關於古拉斯納卡和它的子嗣的細節。\n"
"睡鼠長長地呼了口氣，虛弱地微笑，繼續他完全甦醒的過程，“他們可能是瘋的，但朋友就是朋友。我很驚訝——老實說，也很高興——你沒有因為他們的麻煩而痛打他們一頓。”"

The Hare sits motionless with a pained face, staring off into the distance, pupils twitching slightly.  The loss of his companion seems to have cracked the Hare's mind entirely.\n"
