"Rarely in Wonderland do you see anything uniform or well-ordered, so it strikes you especially strangely when you happen across a grove of trees that have grown inexplicably into heart shapes.  The glade itself is also shaped like a heart, tapering inward toward an especially large tree with a red door embedded in it.  Whoever - or whatever - created this grove may be able to help you in stabilizing Alice's dreams.  You step through the door without delay.\n"
"The other side of the door might as well have been another world, as it leads to a vast garden surrounding an enormous castle.  The same heart patterns adorn each flowerbed and topiary bush, most decorated in a bright red color.  You have only a moment to consider who would be so fixated on hearts before a platoon of strange figures approach you.  The figures look like playing cards in all four suits, but each with heads, hands and feet.  The fact that they brandish spears at you vindictively takes some of the humor out of their appearance.  You raise your hands to diffuse the situation just as the ranks of the cards part.\n"
"Another regal figure walks proudly but aggressively toward you.  From her appearance, and connecting the look of the castle around you, it could only be the Queen of Hearts.  She keeps her jaw tightly clenched as she regards you with suspicion.  After a few moments, she begins to speak in a tone that suggests inner rage.  \"And who are you to intrude upon my castle?!\" she accuses gruffly, \"Just the sort of unseemly type to skulk and thieve!\"  You try to smooth things over with the intimidating monarch, but she scoffs openly at you.  \"Don't contradict a queen!  You appear scant moments after my tarts were stolen away, on my unbirthday, no less, and you try to claim coincidence?!  Rubbish and lies!  Off with your head!\"  She storms away, still bellowing for blood, and her entourage of soldiers merely bars your exit.  You wait for a moment in confused silence as nobody attempts to take you away for execution.  Either this is commonplace, or the executioner isn't a real go-getter.\n"
"The Cheshire Cat appears beside you once more, watching the queen and her soldiers depart.  \"Heady times indeed,\" it purrs, \"and you have the great luck of being here at the crux of it.  The queen does love her tarts so, nearly as much as she loves a good beheading.\"  The cat's head floats away from its body as he speaks to punctuate his statement.  \"They'll have a trial shortly, I should think, but were I you, I wouldn't want my name at the top of any lists.  Blame is the name of the game at the Queen's court, and you would do well to learn it quickly.  But I've every confidence in you.  You've a good head on your shoulders… for now.\"  It vanishes once more with a wide grin, leaving you to figure out how best to save your neck from the headsman's axe."

"你很少在仙境中看到任何整齊劃一或井井有條的東西，所以當你穿越一片莫名地長成心形的樹林時，你感到特別奇怪。林間空地也呈心形，向內逐漸變窄，對著一棵特別大的樹，樹上嵌著一扇紅色的門。無論是誰——或是何物事——創造了這片小樹林，也許能幫助你穩定愛麗絲的夢境。你毫不遲疑地走進了門。\n"
"門的另一邊就像是另一個世界，它通向一個廣闊的花園，環繞著一座巨大的城堡。每個花壇和修剪過的灌木都裝飾著相同的心形圖案，大部分都是鮮紅色的。你思考著誰會如此痴迷於心形圖樣，但只過了一會兒，就有一排奇怪的角色接近你。這些人看起來像是撲克牌，四種花色都有，但每個人都有頭、手和腳。他們惡毒地向你揮舞長矛，使得他們滑稽的外觀不怎麼好笑。當撲克牌的行列分散開來時，你連忙舉起手投降。\n"
"又一個皇室的角色傲慢又充滿攻擊性地向你走來。從她的外表看來，再加上四周城堡的模樣，她肯定就是紅心皇后。她的牙關緊緊地咬著，懷疑地看著你。過了一會兒，她用一種顯然內心充滿憤怒的語氣開始說話。“你是誰，竟敢闖入我的城堡？！”她粗聲粗氣地指責道，“我看就是那種見不得人、偷偷摸摸的傢伙！”你試圖緩和情況，但這個令人畏懼的統治者毫不掩飾地譏笑你。“不要和皇后辯解！在我的非生日這天，我的餡餅被偷之後，你就這麼剛好突然冒出來，還想宣稱這是巧合？！鬼話連篇！砍掉你的頭！”她氣沖沖地離去，一邊還咆哮著要見血，而她的隨從士兵們只是阻擋你離開。在一陣困惑的沉默中，你等待了片刻，但沒有人要帶你去行刑。要不這是司空見慣的情況，要不就是劊子手不怎麼有幹勁。\n"
"柴郡貓再次出現在你身邊，看著皇后和她的士兵離開。“真是令人頭痛。”它咕噥著說，“在這緊要關頭來到這裡，你可真幸運。皇后對她的餡餅的熱情，就如同她熱愛砍別人的頭一樣。”貓說到一個斷點，他的頭飄離他的身體。“我想他們很快就會舉行一場審判，但如果我是你，我不會想看到我的名字出現在任何名單上的前幾位。皇后審判庭玩的叫做怪罪遊戲，你最好趕快學會。我對你可充滿信心。你肩膀上這腦袋很好……至少目前是。”它咧著大大的笑容再次消失了，留下你，而你最好得弄清楚該如何從劊子手的斧頭中拯救你的脖子。"

"\"A perfectly simple case!\" the King of Hearts declares, banging his gavel.  He looks to the jurors who all nod enthusiastically and hold up chalkboards with \"guilty\" scrawled on them, most with a variety of spelling errors.  \"No evidence or witnesses to speak of!  Never has a verdict been reached more swiftly, I dare say!  Guilty on all charges, off-\"\n"
"\"-WITH YOUR HEAD!\" the Queen shouts over the King to finish the phrase.  Your protests are drowned out by the continued shouting of the Queen and the cheering of the crowds, who all eagerly await the pending sentence.  The card guards haul you out of the courtroom toward a bloody chopping block in an open courtyard.  The executioner stands beside it, running his thumb over the blade of his axe to test its sharpness.  \"Not to worry, I'm a professional.\" he assures you in a surprisingly pleasant tone, \"Just one quick chop and that'll be the end of it.  You won't feel a thing.\""

"“這是一起非常簡單的案件！”紅心國王敲下木槌宣判道。他看向陪審團，他們都踴躍地點頭，舉起寫著“有罪”的黑板，其中大半都有各種拼寫錯誤。“沒有任何證據或證人！我敢說，沒有比這更快速的判決了！所有指控都有罪，砍——”\n"
"“——掉你的頭！”皇后向國王大喊，替他完成這句話。你的抗議被皇后不斷的喊叫聲和人群的歡呼聲淹沒了，他們都熱切地等待著判決。撲克牌守衛把你拖出法庭，拖往一個空曠庭院裡的血淋淋的枕木。劊子手站在旁邊，用拇指劃過斧頭，測試它的鋒利度。“別擔心，我是專業的。”他用一種令人驚訝的愉快語氣向你保證，“只要快速砍一刀就結束了。你不會有什麼感覺的。”"

"You've managed to convince the Queen's courtiers and guards that you couldn't possibly be the thief, at least long enough for you to make your escape.  Back in the heart-shaped woods now, you put your back to the door in the tree and collapse to the ground.  The disorganized chaos of the rest of Wonderland is almost a relief compared to the nonsensical bureaucracy of the Queen of Hearts.  You rest for a short while before standing slowly, using the tree to brace yourself.  Before you can finish standing, however, you are violently thrown to the ground as something slams against the opposite side of the door.  You scramble back from the door in time to see it ripped from its hinges by a shadowy claw.\n"
"Through the open portal, you can see that the Queen's castle has devolved into pandemonium as shadowy monsters claw it apart rapidly.  The ornate palace and gardens crumble and scatter as the creatures rampage in their pursuit of victims.  The shrieks and wails of the courtiers and guards are only outmatched by the fierce and violent cries of the Queen of Hearts herself.  She may have been a match for the shadows on her own terms, but as Gurathnaka's minions consume her court and palace, they grow too much even for the bloodthirsty royal to overcome.\n"
"You continue your escape before you risk death a second time, fleeing back into the surrounding woods before the shadows can overtake you.  The enraged echoes of the Queen's voice reach you long after you lose sight of the glade, but they are finally and suddenly stifled, and a stark stillness falls over the forest.  You steady your nerves and continue through the woods, checking over your shoulder periodically."

"你成功地說服了皇后的侍臣和守衛，你不可能是小偷，至少拖延時間夠長，足夠你逃跑了。現在你逃回到心形的樹林裡，你把你的背靠在樹幹上的門上，接著倒在地上。與紅心皇后荒謬的官僚作風相比，仙境其他地方雜亂無章的混亂要輕鬆得多。你休息了一會兒，然後扶著樹慢慢站起來。然而，在你還沒完全站定前，你就被猛烈地撞到在地，有東西從門的另一側猛烈地撞擊。你及時從門口爬開，看到門被一隻陰暗的爪子從鉸鏈上撕裂。\n"
"透過被撕開的門，你可以看到皇后的城堡已經化為一片地獄，暗影般怪物快速地將其撕毀。隨著這些怪物在追逐受害者的過程中到處肆虐，華麗的宮殿和花園崩毀四散。只有紅心皇后猛烈的哭喊聲能蓋過其他侍臣和衛兵的尖叫和哀號聲。如果以紅心皇后的條件，她可能可以和暗影匹敵，但隨著古拉斯納卡的爪牙吞噬了她的審判庭和宮殿，暗影的力量增長太多，即使嗜血的皇族也無法戰勝它們了。\n"
"你在再次面臨死亡的危險之前繼續逃跑，在暗影追上你之前逃回周圍的樹林。在林間空地離開你視線很長一段時間後，仍然還聽得到皇后憤怒聲音的回音，但最終聲音戛然而止，一片完全的死寂籠罩著整個森林。你讓自己平靜下來，繼續穿過樹林，不時緊張地東張西望。"

msgid "Your opportunity to attack arrives as the shadows rush out toward the Queen in her overemotional state.  You strike at the dark creatures, expecting the Knave to join you, but he stands and stares at the Queen, taken completely aback.  The Queen has seized her executioner's axe and is focusing her anger toward destroying the advancing shadows.  You slow your own assault and eventually stop to join in the Knave's staring as the Queen slices the dark minions to ribbons, screaming for blood and murder all the while.  It feels like barely any time has passed before every last shadow in the Queen's palace has either fallen to her furious assault, or retreated away from the castle.  Neither you nor the Knave had predicted this outcome at all, but it certainly was effective."
msgstr "當陰影衝向過度情緒化的皇后時，你攻擊的機會來了。你向黑暗生物攻擊，期待傑克會一起加入，但他只是站在那邊盯著皇后，完全陷入震驚。皇后拿起了劊子手的斧頭，將她的憤怒集中在摧毀進犯的暗影上。你放慢自己的攻擊，最後停下來和傑克一起旁觀，皇后將黑暗的爪牙切成絲，一邊還不停尖叫著要血流成河。你感覺幾乎沒有經過多少時間，皇后宮殿裡的每個影子要不落入她的猛烈攻擊，要不就撤離城堡了。你和傑克都沒有預料到這個結果，但確實很有效果。"

msgid "Even after brutally dispatching the shadows, the Queen's anger isn't satisfied yet.  She marches toward you with fire still burning in her eyes and the executioner's axe still in hand.  Someone is going to die for what she just went through, and you are still at the top of her list.  You look to the Knave and he looks to you, his eyes narrowing.  Is he prepared to sell you out to save his own head?  Are you prepared to do the same?  You have little time to think the dilemma over before the Queen cuts you short."
msgstr "即使在殘暴地驅逐了陰影後，皇后的憤怒仍然沒有得到宣洩。她朝你走過來，眼神裡仍冒著熊熊烈火，手上還拿著劊子手的斧頭。有人得要為了她剛剛經歷的事付出生命的代價，而你仍然在她的名單上的首位。你看向傑克，他也看著你，眼睛瞇了起來。他會出賣你來保全自己的腦袋嗎？而你會做同樣的事情嗎？在皇后砍你之前，你只有一點點時間思考這個困境。"

"Even with death looming, you have to admit that owe the destruction of the shadows largely to the Knave and his plan.  Before he can speak, you vouch for the Knave and try to calm the Queen, but unfortunately she's beyond reason.  She swings wildly at you both, and you scatter while she screams for her guards.  You flee through the palace, wondering how you might escape her clutches, when the Knave pulls you into the hedges.  He leads you down a circuitous route that avoids the guard patrols and gradually winds its way to the door in the tree.\n"
"\"I don't suppose you'd mind if I tagged along for the time being?\" the Knave asks you with a hint of uncertainty in his voice, \"I won't be welcome in the court anymore by any means, and… I really must admit, I didn't expect any sort of loyalty from you.  The least I can do is return it.\"  One surprise deserves another as you've gained an unlikely ally in the scheming nobleman, though you're relieved for it to be a beneficial surprise this time."

"即使面臨死亡的威脅，你也不得不承認，摧毀暗影很大程度上要歸功於傑克和他的計劃。在他說話之前，你為傑克擔保，並試著讓皇后平靜下來，但不幸的是，她聽不下去。她向著你們瘋狂地揮舞著斧頭，當她尖叫著呼喚守衛時，你們連忙分頭逃跑。你逃離了宮殿，正盤算著如何才能逃脫她的魔掌時，傑克把你拉進樹籬裡。他帶領你沿著一條迂迴的路線避開守衛巡邏，並逐漸繞道到了樹幹上的門。\n"
"“我想你應該不會介意我暫時跟著你吧？”傑克的聲音裡帶著一絲不確定，“無論如何，我在審判庭上可不會受到歡迎，而且……我真的必須承認，我沒想到你對我會有任何的忠誠。至少我得做點回報。”一個意外接著一個，你竟然在狡詐的貴族中獲得了一個難得的盟友，這次你很高興它是一個好的意外。"

msgid "The Queen's attention snaps to the Knave at your quick accusation.  The nobleman's nerve fails him as he tries to deflect blame back at you while the Queen advances.  He finally tries to flee, but too late as the axe swings.  In one clean motion, the Knave's head launches from his shoulder and rolls to a stop several yards away.  You try to slip away as well, but the sudden arrival of a battalion of card guards hems you in close to the Queen.  Tense seconds pass, but finally the Queen turns to you with a pleasant expression on her face, in contrast to the blood on her hands and dress.  \"You've done me quite a service in finding the thief and saving us the trouble of a trial!  And such service deserves a reward!  Seeing as my executioner has been lax in his duties, I hereby award you the rank and responsibilities of royal executioner instead.\"  She shoves the axe into your hands and strides demurely away, leaving you disturbed, but alive."
msgstr "在你快速的指控下，皇后的注意力迅速轉移到傑克身上。這位貴族試圖將怪罪轉移回到你身上，但隨著皇后的逼近，他失去了勇氣。他最終試圖逃跑，但為時已晚，斧頭已經揮下。乾淨的一刀下去，傑克的頭就從他的肩膀上飛出來，滾到幾碼外停了下來。你也試著溜走，但突然到來的一隊撲克牌守衛將你包圍在皇后的身邊。過了緊張的幾秒鐘後，終於皇后以和善的表情轉向你，與她手上和衣服上的鮮血形成強烈的對比。“你為我找到了小偷，省去了審判的麻煩！這樣的貢獻值得獎勵！鑑於我的劊子手失職，我特此授予你軍銜以及皇家劊子手的職務。”她將斧頭塞到你的手中，端莊地大步離開，留下不安的你，但至少還活著。"

"Even after the shadows have been chopped to bits, the Queen keeps up her furious attacks, dicing them into yet finer bits while screaming about her tarts.  You and the Knave wait until the Queen has worn herself out before you dare approach her.  She whirls around to meet you, but her expression has lifted to a smile.  \"Vermin of some sort, I might have guessed that they would steal my lovely tarts!\"  The Knave quickly affirms her false suspicion and you nod in agreement, not wanting to provoke the Queen any further.  \"If only I wasn't forced to dispose of them myself.  I require a new executioner!\"  The Queen's eyes settle on you at once and she shoves the axe into your hands.  \"You will do, my congratulations.\"  She marches off, calling for the fresh batch of tarts on the double as she goes.\n"
"The Knave pulls you aside as soon as the Queen is out of sight.  \"I hadn't expected success on that scale, or… any scale, really.  I had intended to take my leave as soon as the shadows had been drawn out, but you really did complicate things, for the better, I must say.  All of this is I suppose to say… I do owe you quite a bit.  If I can assist you - within reason, of course - then I shall be eag- erm, willing to do so.\"  Within reason, he says.  There's none of that to be had in Wonderland, but you'll have plenty of use for the Knave's underhanded talents all the same."

"即使暗影已被切成碎片，皇后仍然繼續她猛烈的攻擊，將它們切得更細碎，一邊還尖叫著關於她的餡餅。等到皇后精疲力竭，你和傑克才敢接近她。她轉過身來面對你，但表情已經變成了微笑。“只是某種害蟲，我大概有猜到就是它們偷走我可愛的餡餅！”傑克馬上對她錯誤的懷疑連番稱是，你也點頭表示同意，不想再激怒皇后了。“真希望我不用被迫自己處理它們。我需要一個新的劊子手！”皇后的目光立刻落在了你身上，她把斧頭塞到了你的手中。“你來做吧，恭喜你了。”她大步離開，邊走邊喊著要雙份新出爐的餡餅。\n"
"皇后一離開視線，傑克就把你拉到一邊。“我沒想到會以這種方式成功，或者……任何方式，老實說。我本來打算等暗影被引誘出來就逃走，你確實把事情變複雜了，但我必須說，是往好的方向。我想說的就是這些……我確實欠你不少。如果我能幫上你的忙——當然是在合理的範圍內——那麼我會很高……呃，願意去做。”他說合理範圍，在仙境中可沒有這回事。但你還是可以好好利用傑克偷雞摸狗的才能。"
