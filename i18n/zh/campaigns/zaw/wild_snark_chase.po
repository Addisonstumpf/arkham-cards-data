"The forest around you grows darker and more tangled with each step.  It reminds you of the witch-haunted woods on the outskirts of Arkham in several respects.  Each echoing sound might be some eerie creature stalking your steps, or another of Gurathnaka's shadows hungering for your essence.  Your worries escalate as the clear path you'd been following dead-ends in a bramble patch.  You scan the tangle for any sign of a way through or around, but without any promise.  Your eyes return to the path you arrived by, only to find that the forest has swallowed it without any trace.  It's almost as if the woods themselves were actively working to confuse you, like many of Wonderland's other denizens.  Now at a loss for direction, you stumble forward through the rough terrain as long as the fading light allows.  Each passing moment gradually amplifies your fear of being ambushed out from the darkness.  You press on until finally, at the foot of a gnarled tree, you make a campfire from the fallen branches to wait out the night.\n"
"Not an hour into your rest, you are awoken by the clanging of a bell and the clamor of nearby voices.  You rouse yourself from sleep and find that your campfire is somehow missing, though a purring chuckle directs your attention above your head.  The Cheshire Cat holds the burning logs in two paws, waving them like signal lanterns.  Noticing that you've awoken, the cat grins and sets the fire back down before disappearing once more.  A crowd of ten figures rushes eagerly into the clearing around the tree, only to stop with groans and sighs.  \"Tisn't a Snark at all!\" a proud looking man cries, waving his bell for attention.  \"Though Snarks are handy for striking a light, this one's been lit by someone or other.\"  The hunters seat themselves around your fire with several shows of exhaustion.  \"At least it wasn't a Boojum…\" a man with a baker's hat mutters as he wipes the sweat from his brow thankfully.\n"
"\"We'd all have vanished away were that the case!\" the Bellman retorts, seating himself beside you.  He looks you over for a moment as if just noticing you and stands once more.  \"By chance, would you also be hunting a Snark?\"  You shake your head and explain that you've gotten lost in the woods here.  \"What luck, we're lost as well!\" he exclaims with a smile, \"but a Snark's the cure for that!  A Snark is useful for a great many things, and finding one's way surely might be one of them.  You're quite welcome to join our search… pending your profession.\"  You look to the hunters and see a banker, a butcher, a beaver, and others all with jobs beginning with \"b.\"  You think for a moment and tell the Bellman that you could be considered a bodyguard, and he leads his fellows in a cheer.  \"Just what we chiefly need!  We'll find the Snark in no time at all now!  The Tulgey Wood may be dense as a dunce and thicker than thieves, but we'll find the Snark in spite of it!\""

"你周圍的森林隨著你的每個腳步變得更黑暗、更糾纏。它在某方面讓你想起了阿卡姆郊區那個女巫出沒的樹林。每次響起的聲音都可能是某種怪異的生物在跟蹤你的足跡，或是另一個古拉斯納卡的影子在渴求你的精華。你沿著小路走，當路徑在一叢荊棘中來到盡頭時，你的憂慮加深了。你環視四周糾纏在一起的樹林，尋找任何能穿過或繞過的方法，但一無所獲。你將目光轉回到你來的路徑上，卻發現森林已經將它吞噬得無影無踪。這就像是樹林本身正在主動迷惑你，如同仙境的許多其他居民一樣。現在你迷失了方向，你在崎嶇的地形中僅靠著昏暗的光線蹣跚前行。在黑暗中被伏擊的恐懼隨著時間逐漸放大。你勉強繼續前進，終於來到一棵長滿瘤的樹下，你用落下的樹枝生起篝火，等待夜晚過去。\n"
"休息不到一個小時，你就被響亮的鈴聲和附近的喧鬧聲吵醒了。你從睡夢中醒來，發現你的篝火不知何故不見了，但一陣呼嚕呼嚕的笑聲將你的注意力引到頭頂。柴郡貓用兩隻爪子抓著燃燒的原木，像信號燈一樣揮舞著它們。貓注意到你已經醒來，咧嘴一笑，把火放回去，然後再次消失。十個人影急切地衝進了樹周遭的空地，然後停下來呻吟和嘆息。“根本就不是蛇鯊！”一個看起來很自滿的男人喊道，揮舞手中的鈴以引起注意。“雖然蛇鯊可以很便利地發光，但這個光源是被其他人或其他東西點亮的。”獵人們坐在你的火堆旁，其中幾人已顯得疲憊。“至少牠不是布瓊姆……”一個戴著麵包師帽的男人低聲道，他滿懷感激地擦了擦額頭上的汗水。\n"
"“如果是的話，我們早就都消失了！”搖鈴人反駁道，在你旁邊坐下。他看了你一會兒，然後就像是剛注意到你，再次站了起來。“你會不會碰巧也在抓蛇鯊？”你搖搖頭，解釋說你在樹林裡迷路了。“真幸運，我們也迷路了！”他笑著喊道，“但蛇鯊能解決這個問題！蛇鯊在很多事情上都很有用處，你肯定也能找到自己的使用方式。我們非常歡迎你加入我們的搜索……但你要有個職業。”你看向獵人、然後是銀行家、屠夫、海狸和其他人，他們的職業都以“b”開頭。你想了一會兒，然後告訴搖鈴人你可以當保鏢，他帶著他的伙伴們一起歡呼。“這正是我們最需要的！我們馬上就能找到蛇鯊了！土爾基森林可能比蠢蛋更蠢，比盜賊更賊，儘管如此，我們還是會找到蛇鯊的！”"

Moments pass fearfully until you spot movement out of the corner of your eye.  At first, the form looks like one of the shadows, but as it grows closer, there can be no doubt.  It's a Snark!  You start to call for the hunters when you notice a hint of malice in the creature's eyes.  The Bellman didn't mention anything like this about the Snark.  You rapidly rack your brain until you recall a comment about something called a Boojum.  From what the hunters discussed, it's a creature that resembles a Snark, but should you meet it, you will softly and suddenly vanish away.  You look up and realize too late that it's a Boo-"

msgid "Again and again the horrible Jabberwock swoops in to attack you, and each time you beat the monster back.  The beast drips with a foul ichor from its wounds that grow with each skirmish, and yet it continues its assault without any hesitation.  The Jabberwock grasps at you with a furious howl, and you strike back hard and true.  Your final blow separates the creature's head from its body in a fantastic shower of gore, and the hulking body collapses to the forest floor, twitching and spasming.  You recuperate slowly, put off by the monster's death throes, but still alive with a feeling of victory slowly building inside you.  The nearby members of the expedition look to you with surprise and tell themselves that you could certainly use an extra ration of grog for saving them from the beast."
msgstr "恐怖的查博蕪基龍一次又一次地突襲攻擊你，而每一次你都將牠擊退。隨著每次交手，這隻野獸的傷口漸增，從其中流出惡臭的膿液，但牠仍然毫不猶豫地繼續攻擊。查博蕪基龍憤怒地嚎叫，向你抓攫，而你紮紮實實地反擊。你的最後一擊將這生物的頭與身體分開，形成一場幻想般的血腥雨，牠笨重的身體倒在林中的地面上，抽搐痙攣。你緩緩喘過氣，被怪物的垂死掙扎嚇了一跳，但仍活著，你心中慢慢體會到勝利的感覺。附近的探險隊成員驚訝地看著你，暗自承諾絕對要額外分給你一份酒，感謝你從野獸手中拯救他們。"

Try as you might, you simply cannot find a pattern to its attacks nor pin it down for any decent length of time.  The Jabberwock seems to have a particular hatred for the blade that the Bellman uncovered, striking at your sword arm each time it ambushes you.  In desperation to avoid becoming another victim, you throw down the strange sword, and the Jabberwock seizes it at once.  It focuses its attacks on the blade as you flee to a safer distance, only turning around once you hear the snap of shattering metal.  With a roar of triumph, the monster vanishes once more into the night, leaving you to nurse your wounds with the few members of the expedition who survived its fiery wrath."
msgstr "這個邪惡的生物無情地攻擊你和森林中的其他獵人。你盡力嘗試，但完全無法找到牠的攻擊模式，也無法追蹤牠足夠長的時間。查博蕪基龍似乎特別痛恨搖鈴人發現的劍，每次伏擊時牠都會攻擊你握劍的手。你不顧一切地扔掉了奇怪的劍，避免成為另一個受害者，而查博蕪基龍立刻抓住了劍。你趁牠攻擊那把劍的時候逃到安全的距離，只有在聽到金屬碎裂的聲音時轉身看了一次。怪物隨著勝利的咆哮聲再次消失在夜色中，留下你和其他少數倖存下來的探險隊成員替自己療傷。"

"Regrets fill your mind as you flee the Tulgey Wood.  You're frustrated by fleeing the woods ungracefully, by not catching the Snark, and by even joining the hunt in the first place.  The echoes of the other hunters gradually reaching their own untimely ends reverberates between the trees.  Each short series of shouts and shrieks inevitably ends in a sudden silence.  The distant sound of the Bellman's ringing is the last thing to fade into the night, bringing an end to the disastrous expedition.\n"
"You take only a few steps more before a rushing sound of air builds behind you.  You turn in dread to see a blanket of darkness sweeping over the forest, extinguishing every speck of light in its path.  Not wanting to strain your luck any further, you break into a sprint.  Your own lights flicker and begin to fade as you keep just ahead of the advancing wave.  Step by step you maneuver over the rough terrain, daring not look back again, until a ray of morning sun blinds you suddenly.  You collapse down in confusion and exhaustion, expecting the worst, but the wave of darkness has receded once again."

"你心中滿是懊悔地逃離土爾基森林。你為灰頭塗臉地逃離森林、沒有抓住蛇鯊而感到沮喪，甚至後悔最初加入狩獵。其他獵人逐漸各自遇上他們自己太早到來的結局，聲響在樹木之間迴盪。每次短促的叫喊聲和尖叫聲都注定倏地沉默下來。遠處搖鈴人的鈴聲是最後一個消失在夜色中的東西，為這場災難性的探險畫上了句號。\n"
"你只多走了幾步，身後就傳來一陣劃破空氣的急促聲響。你恐懼地轉身，看到一片黑暗席捲森林，熄滅了路徑上的每一個光點。你不想賭運氣，拼命往前衝刺。你勉強跑在前進的黑暗浪潮前頭，自己的燈火也開始閃爍、褪色。你不敢再回頭，一步一步地在崎嶇的地形上前進，直到突然有一縷晨光使你感到刺眼。你在困惑和疲憊中倒下，做好了最壞的準備，但黑暗的浪潮再次退去。"

"The Snark looks up at you meekly, almost tamely, as the other hunters gather around to view their prize up close in the fading darkness.  Questions fly and theories puncture each other until the Bellman gathers everyone's attention once more.  \"We have found success, or rather success has found us, given the circumstances!  Three cheers for the Bodyguard who first laid hands on the beast!\"  The hunters cheer and call for a celebratory feast, but with only the Snark available to cook, they agree it would be a terrible waste.\n"
"The Snark in the meantime sits quietly in the center of the group.  The many purported uses for the beast seem beyond its capabilities, but for its ability to lead you safely out of the woods.  The Snark - and you by extension - must know every inch of these woods by now, for all that you covered during the chase.  For minutes at a time, it studies each of the hunters in turn before directing its attention back at you.  The creature is observant, another quality that no doubt helped it stay out of harm's way until recently.  You stare into the Snark's eyes, and you lock for several seconds before it speaks to you in perfect English.  \"I've been told it's rude to stare.\""

"其他獵人在消散的黑暗中聚集在一起，近距離觀察他們的戰利品，而蛇鯊安靜地抬頭看著你，近乎溫馴。問題此起彼落，各種理論互相駁斥，直到搖鈴人再次集中了所有人的注意力。“我們得到了成功，或者說，照目前的情況，成功得到了我們！為率先找到獵物的保鏢歡呼三聲！”獵人們歡呼並喊著要舉行慶祝的宴會，但可以拿來煮的只有蛇鯊，大家都同意這將是一種可怕的浪費。\n"
"與此同時，蛇鯊靜靜地坐在眾人中間。這隻野獸許多據稱的用途似乎過譽了，但牠的確有能力帶領你安全地走出森林。蛇鯊——還有你——現在已對這些樹林瞭若指掌，因為你在獵捕過程中已學習到許多。牠輪流花幾分鐘研究每個獵人，然後將注意力再次轉回你身上。這種生物很敏銳，這種特性無疑地幫助牠遠離傷害，直到被你抓住。你盯著蛇鯊的眼睛看了好幾秒鐘，然後牠用純正的英語對你開口說話。“有人說盯著別人看是不禮貌的。”"

Your duty and honor should now be the first use of Snark!\"  He gathers the hunters around you and the creature, watching expectantly.

Finally, only the Bellman remains standing next to you.  \"Through all the months and weeks of hunting, it never occurred what might proceed the finding of the Snark.  Should you have another expedition in mind, I would gladly pass the days as its leader.\"  Another ally would be welcome as you traverse the rest of Wonderland to save both Arkham and Alice, and so you tell the Bellman just enough about your journey to recruit him without any fuss."

"在你能回應或利用蛇鯊之前，搖鈴人從討論中回來了，他一隻手拿著瓶子，另一隻手拿著他的鈴。他把鈴拿給你喝，然後搖著瓶子，好像在敲鈴。你婉拒了。“在我們慶祝完抓到蛇鯊之後，我會再找時間獎勵你的勤奮。”他說道。你勸搖鈴人在離開愈發黑暗的森林後，再舉行所有的慶祝。“有道理，”搖鈴人沉思道，“如果這次冒險的隊長不是我，你的確能做個好隊長。現在蛇鯊的第一個用途應該就是你的職責和榮譽！”他把獵人們集合在你和這個生物周圍，期待地看著你們。你要求蛇鯊帶你們離開土爾基森林，如果牠做得到。牠點頭、聳肩、抽搐、旋轉，然後突然——\n"
