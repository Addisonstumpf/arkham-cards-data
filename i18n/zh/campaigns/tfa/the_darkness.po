msgid "Interlude V"
msgstr "幕間故事V"

msgid "You stir awake, lying facedown on the cold, hard stone of the cavern. You are bruised and battered but, somehow, alive. It takes several minutes before you regain enough of your strength to stand. You are absolutely and hopelessly lost within the impossibly vast caverns, enveloped by pitch-black darkness. Have you survived all this way only to perish here, lost to all humanity?"
msgstr "你醒了過來，面朝下躺在冰冷而堅硬的洞穴岩石上。你鼻青臉腫，像是挨了一頓毒打，但不知為何你仍然活著。花了好幾分鐘，你才恢復了些氣力，能夠站起身來。在這個龐大到難以置信的洞窟裡，你徹底迷失了方向，全無希望，周圍籠罩著的是猶如瀝青的黑暗。你只能這樣苟存性命，靜待死亡來臨，與人類永別？"

msgid "The grim, blood-red caverns and resentful cities of Yoth hold no candle to the terrifying depths that lie below them. You are in the deepest level of this subterranean realm now: the caverns Ichtaca referred to as “N’kai.” Nothing could have prepared you for the impervious murk that surrounds you on all sides, an inky darkness that none of your light sources can penetrate. You grope around in the darkness until you feel the jagged wall of the cavern and begin to follow it aimlessly, desperately hoping to find the way forward. A grim realization dawns on you: Even should you complete your task, you will surely never find a way back to the surface. The overwhelming darkness of the cavern fills you with a dread you have never before experienced. You cannot see your hands as you grope about in the darkness, nor can you tell if you are in a narrow tunnel or a vast open space. The ground beside you could extend for miles or abruptly become a bottomless cavern, and you would not be able to tell the difference unless you stepped there. Hours pass as you stumble in the dark, slowly, carefully, nervously. Every step could be your last."
msgstr "昏暗而血紅的洞穴，以及名為幽嘶的滿腔仇恨的城市，都無法與其下方的可怖深淵相提並論。你所在的正是這地下領域的最深層：伊塔卡提過的名為“恩凱”的洞穴。你四面八方都是密不透風的黑暗，你的所有装備都無法應對當前的處境，一切光源都無法穿透這漆黑。你在黑暗中四處摸索，終於觸碰到洞穴的凹凸岩壁，你開始漫無目的地循著它前行，只想要趕快找到出路。你突然意識到：即使你完成了自己的任務，你也肯定找不到回到地面的路。洞穴裡鋪天蓋地的黑暗讓你心生懼意，在此之前你從未如此懼怕。當你在黑暗中摸索時，你看不見自己的雙手，也不知道自己是在一條狹窄的隧道裡，還是在一片開闊的空間裡。你周遭的地面可能有連續展開的幾英里長，也可能突然出現一個無底深洞，而你只有踩上去才能分辨。你跌跌撞撞地在黑暗中走了好幾個小時，步履緩慢，謹慎而緊張。你所走的每一步都可能是你的最後一步。"

msgid "Check Campaign Log. <i>If the investigators found the missing relic</i>, the lead investigator reads <b>Arcane Thrumming</b>."
msgstr "查看冒險日誌。如果<i>調查員找回了丢失的遺物</i>，調查員隊長閱讀<b>神祕的嗡嗡聲</b>。"

msgid "Worried that your fall may have damaged the Eztli relic, you pull it out of your pack and examine it. Oddly, the device seems completely undamaged. It vibrates with a growing intensity, humming louder now than ever before."
msgstr "你擔心自己的墜落會使埃茲特里的遺物受到損傷，於是你將它從背包中取出，仔細檢查。古怪的是，這件器具似乎完好無損。它震動得愈發激烈，嗡啥的響聲也變得更加響亮。"

msgid "Check Campaign Log. <i>If the investigators recovered the Relic of Ages</i>, and <i>if you are forging your own path</i>, read <b>Final Dawning</b>. Otherwise, you suffer no ill effects."

msgid "Final Dawning"
msgstr "茅塞頓開"

msgid "Without Alejandro or Ichtaca to distract you, you find yourself studying the relic intently. Both of your “guides” have only fed you lies. They hid the relic’s true nature from you, manipulating you in an attempt to bring the relic to this very place. After your experience with the Great Race of Yith, you think you understand why. The technology behind the device’s design is far beyond what any human could accomplish, but quite possible for the Yithians. You even recognize some elements of the relic’s construction from the technology in Pnakotus. Somehow, it ended up in the hands of the Eztli, who defended it with care from all manner of creatures. Creatures that predate humanity. Creatures who wished to use it to turn back time. And now that the relic is in your possession, only you can stop this from occurring."
msgstr "沒有亞歴山卓和伊塔卡在旁令你分心，你發現自己能夠更加專心地研究遺物。你的兩位“嚮導”都曾對你說謊。他們對你隱瞞了遺物的真相，還利用你將遺物帶到此地。在與偉大種族伊斯相處之後，你認為自己已經了解這背後的原因。這件器具的設計背後的技術遠非人類所能及，反而很有可能是出自伊斯人之手。你甚至認出了這件遺物結構裡的某些部件是出自納克特的技術。但不知為何，它最終落入埃兹特里人之手，在他們的保護之下未受任何生物的沾染，那些比人類歷史更早的生物，它們企圖用遺物來回溯時光。而如今這件遺物落在你手，只有你才能阻止這一切發生。"

msgid "The investigator with Relic of Ages in their deck swaps it with the new version of Relic of Ages included in this Mythos Pack: Relic of Ages (<i>Repossess the Past</i>)."
msgstr "如果調查員的牌組內有古代遺物，將它替換成本神秘檔案中新版本的古代遺物：古代遺物(<i>重拾往昔</i>)。"

msgid "As you rise to your feet, the ground rumbles and growls. Something deep below you is moving. Shifting. Mutating."
msgstr "就在你站起身的時候，地面傳來了轟隆聲和咆哮聲。你下方有什麼東西正在移動。位置飄忽。變化無定。"

msgid "Though the light from your torches is snuffed by the overpowering darkness of this realm, you decide to try to light the brazier with the flames. To your surprise, after you hold the torch against the strange cubes for several moments, the brazier erupts in a fury of blue and silver flames, consuming your torch and almost melting your hand to the bone. Though the light from the brilliant flame only reaches a few yards around you, more braziers light up in the distance, their flames guiding your path forward. At least, you hope..."
msgstr "儘管你火把的光亮被這地下領域壓倒性的黑暗所吞沒，你還是決定用火焰點亮這個火盆。讓你驚奇的是，在你將火把對著那些怪異的方塊片刻過後，火盆突然噴發出銀藍色的火焰，燃盡了你的火把，還幾乎把你的手燒剩白骨。儘管這束明亮的火焰只照亮了你周圍幾碼的範圍，但遠處更多的火盆相繼亮起，它們的火焰將指引你前進的道路。至少，你希望如此……"

msgid "In your Campaign Log, record that <i>the braziers are lit</i>."
msgstr "在冒險日誌中，記錄下<i>你點燃了火盆</i>。"

msgid "The odd material inside does not seem to accept any source of fire you use to try to light it. Your hope is snuffed out along with the light around you. Miserable, you prepare to endure the darkness ahead."
msgstr "你用盡一切火源試圖點燃這火盆，但似乎無法點著它内部的特異材料。你心中的希望也跟身旁的光亮一同被吞沒。強忍著心中的苦澀，你準備繼續摸黑前行。"

msgstr "解讀印記"

msgid "As you traverse the caverns, something catches your attention: streams of cold, gentle water that drip down the walls of the cavern. Curious, you unfold the previous expedition’s map and sit by one of the lit braziers, mentally retracing your steps. If your calculations are correct, you have traveled much farther south than you could have possibly guessed. Could it be these caverns extend all the way to the coastline? Do the caverns never end?"
msgstr "就在你穿過洞穴時，有什麼東西吸引了你的注意：有一股冰冷而輕緩的水流從洞穴的石壁流下。你好奇地打開前一次探險的地圖，在點燃的火盆旁邊坐下，回想著你經過的路。如果你的推算無誤，你向南走了很遠的距離，比所能想像的要更遠。這些洞穴會一直延伸到海岸線嗎？還是說永遠不會到盡頭？"

msgid "Each investigator with a map earns 2 additional experience as they gain insight into the caverns that dwell beneath the surface of the Earth."
msgstr "調查員洞察了地表以下的洞穴群，每位帶有地圖的調查員獲得2點額外的經驗值。"
