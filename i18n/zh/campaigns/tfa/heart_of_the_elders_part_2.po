msgid "You descend down miles of steep, cold stone. The tunnels are chokingly narrow at first, filled with rubble and detritus. Finally, you reach level ground, and the cavern’s true nature reveals itself before you. It is as though there were an entire world below the surface; the cavern’s ceiling is like a stone curtain of sky above you. Even more vast and terrifying are the endless depths below you, beyond the edges of stone chasms and archaic bridges. On all sides, this underground realm seems to extend beyond the boundary of your sight; you wonder just how far it reaches. Perhaps the entirety of the known surface of the Earth is but the top layer of another world…"
msgstr "你沿著陡峭而冰冷的石塊一路下行了好幾英里。隧道一開始窄得令人窒息，滿是碎石。最後，你到達了一個平層，在你面前是這座洞穴的真實面貌。地面以下彷彿曾經有著一個完整的世界；洞頂就像懸在你頭頂的石質天穹。在這條岩石裂縫和古老橋梁的彼端，你下方的無盡深淵廣無邊際，令人生怖。這個地下領域像是向四面八方延伸到你視線以外；你想知道它到底到達了多遠的地方。或許地球上已知的整個地表，不過是另一個世界的頂層……"

msgid "Put the Mouth of K’n-yan into play, <i>(The Depths Beneath)</i> side faceup. Each investigator begins play at the Mouth of K’n-yan <i>(The Depths Beneath)</i>."
msgstr "將昆揚之口放置入場，<i>(下有深淵)</i>面朝上。每位調查員從昆揚之口<i>(下有深淵)</i>開始遊戲。"

msgid "Search the collection for each card listed in parentheses next to “the jungle watches” in your Campaign Log. Add those cards to the victory display."
msgstr "查看冒險日誌中“叢林監視著你”旁邊的括號內列出的卡牌，搜索收藏找出這些卡牌。將這些卡牌加入勝利牌區。"

msgid "Set the Descent to Yoth location aside, out of play."
msgstr "將深入幽嘶地點放在一邊，位於場外。"

msgid "Create the exploration deck. This is done by taking the 5 remaining single-sided locations from the <i>K’n-yan</i> encounter set and shuffling them together, along with 1 copy each of the following encounter cards: Pitfall, No Turning Back, Deep Dark, and Final Mistake."
msgstr "構建探索牌堆。拿取<i>昆揚</i>遭遇組剩餘的5張單面地點，將這些地點與遭遇卡一同混洗形成探索牌堆，所混洗的遭遇卡為以下每種1張：落入陷阱、無路可退、一片漆黑、致命錯誤。"

msgstr "在冒險日誌中記錄的<i>“預示者還活著”</i>旁邊的括號內記錄瓦盧西亞的預示者上的傷害點數，替代括號內原本記錄的數字。"

msgid "You awaken, lying on rough stone in a place much colder and deeper than before. You stand and take stock of your surroundings, noting the red glow that seems to emanate from the cavern to your left. You follow it for several minutes, until finally it leads you into a well-lit entryway, filled with stone pillars. At the far end of the room lies an ornate and elaborately decorated doorway, a stone disc that has been rolled aside to unveil the hellish realm beyond."
msgstr "你甦醒過來，發現自己處在一個更加寒冷、更深入的地方，躺在一塊粗糙的石塊上。你站起身來，環視周圍環境，注意到一抹紅光，它似乎是從你離開的洞穴發出的。你跟著光芒走了好幾分鐘，最後在其引領下來到一個亮堂的門廊，其中佈滿了石柱。在這間石室遙遠的後方，有著一扇華麗而精緻的大門，一塊石盤被滾到了一旁，開啟彼端如煉獄般的領域。"

msgid "“Finally! Yoth, cavern of the serpents! The cursed ones, who fled the destruction of Valusia!” Alejandro examines the entryway with wonder in his eyes, arms raised in exultation. You know not of what he speaks, and you are beginning to grow worried. Just then, something scutters behind you, and a sound like the click-clacking of a claw catches you by surprise. Emerging from the darkness behind you are several alien creatures, the likes of which you have never seen: ten feet tall, with conical bodies that end in four strange appendages of varying lengths. “There you are,” Alejandro says calmly. One of the creatures responds by clicking its claws against one another in a deliberate pattern. “Take their minds,” Alejandro commands the creatures. “We have no further use for them.” It is your last human memory."
msgstr "“踏破鐵鞋無覓處！幽嘶，萬蛇之穴！從瓦盧西亞的滅頂之災下逃離的、被詛咒的蛇族！”亞歷山卓檢查著大門，雙眼流露出驚奇的神色，興奮地舉起雙臂。你聽不懂他在說些什麼，但你開始有點擔心。就在剛才，你身後傳來急奔的腳步聲，還有一陣咔㗳咔㗳的聲音，彷彿你會突然被一支巨鉗抓住。幾個怪異的生物從你身後的黑暗中現身，你從未見過類似的生物：它們高逾十英呎，有著錐狀的身體，軀幹末尾還有著四根長短不一的奇異附肢。“你們來了。”亞歷山卓平靜地說道。其中一個生物以一種刻意的方式擊打著自己的兩個鉗子，作為應答。“奪走他們的意識。”亞歷山卓指揮這些生物，“我們已經不需要他們了。”這是你作為人類最後的記憶。"

msgid "Before you are able to cross into the next layer of the cavern, a sound like the click-clacking of a claw catches you by surprise. Emerging from the darkness behind you are several alien creatures, the likes of which you have never seen: ten feet tall, with conical bodies that end in four strange appendages of varying lengths. You are stunned to see a human figure standing at the head of the group: none other than Alejandro Vela. “Take their minds,” Alejandro commands the creatures. “We have no further use for them.” It is your last human memory."
msgstr "直到你進入洞穴的下一層之前，一陣咔㗳咔㗳的聲音跟隨著你，彷彿你會突然被一支巨鉗抓住。幾個怪異的生物從你身後的黑暗中現身，你從未見過類似的生物：它們高逾十英呎，有著錐狀的身體，軀幹末尾還有著四根長短不一的奇異附肢。當你看見這群生物的人類首領時，你十分震驚：那人正是亞歷山卓·維拉。“奪走他們的意識。”亞歷山卓指揮這些生物，“我們已經不需要他們了。”這是你作為人類最後的記憶。"
