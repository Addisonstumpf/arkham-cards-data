msgid "Interlude I: Restless Nights"
msgstr "幕間故事I：不眠之夜"

msgid "In order, read each of the following sections:"
msgstr "按順序閱讀以下段落："

msgid "Check your supplies to see which investigators have a blanket."
msgstr "查看你們的補給品，檢查那些調查員帶有毛毯。"

msgid "Restful Sleep"
msgstr "安穩入睡"

msgid "Tossing and Turning"
msgstr "輾轉反側"

msgid "Those nights in the jungle, I barely slept. A strange fog rolled through the camp each night, plunging the area in an intense and peculiar cold. My bedroll offered some protection against the elements, but we hadn’t been prepared for this unnatural weather. Flies and mosquitoes buzzed in my ears every time I began to drift off. Even when I finally slept, I would soon be startled awake by the crawling of an insect or lizard across my face. I wager I’ll get very little sleep on this journey..."
msgstr "在叢林度過的每個夜晚，我都幾乎沒睡著過。一團古怪的霧氣每晚壟罩著營地，使這片區域陷入詭異的嚴寒。我的睡袋多少可以抵擋些嚴寒，但我們並未作準備對應這異常的氣候。每當我將要入睡時，蒼蠅和蚊子就在我的耳朵裡嗡嗡作響。就算我睡著了，也很快會因為昆蟲或蜥蜴在臉上爬來爬去而嚇醒。我敢打賭，我在這趟旅程中睡不了多少時間……"

msgid "Mercifully, I was able to sleep through each night. However, while my body rested, my mind was plagued by nightmares. A cavern like a gaping maw, bathed in dim red light...the walls slithering with the glimmering scales of a hundred vipers...it might have been better had I not slept at all."
msgstr "幸好，我每晚還能入睡。但是，在我的身體得到休息的同時，精神卻受著夢魘的折磨。我夢到身在昏暗的紅光之中，有一處血盆大口一般的洞穴……上百條毒蛇的鱗片在洞壁上閃爍著微光……我情願自己沒睡著。"

msgid "Check your supplies. The investigators, as a group, must cross off one provisions per investigator from their supplies. For each provisions they cannot cross off, choose an investigator to read <b>Low on Rations</b>."
msgstr "查看你們的補給品。調查員以團隊為單位，必須從補給品中劃掉配給，劃掉的數量等於調查員人數。調查員每少劃掉一個配給，選擇一位調查員來閱讀<b>配給不足</b>。"

msgid "We thought we’d brought enough food and water for everybody, but the journey had taken its toll on our supplies. When the sun rose and it came time to eat, we discovered we were already running out of provisions."
msgstr "我們原以為帶的食物和水足夠我們所有人享用，但這趟旅程耗盡了我們的物資。當太陽升起，到了進食的時間，我們發現自己的食物和水都已耗盡。"

msgid "The lead investigator must choose one investigator to be the group’s lookout. Then, that investigator checks their supplies to see if they have binoculars."
msgstr "調查員隊長必須選擇一位調查員來為隊伍放哨。然後，該調查員查看自己的補給品之中是否帶有雙筒望遠鏡。"

msgid "(has binoculars)"
msgstr "(有雙筒望遠鏡)"

msgid "Group's lookout"
msgstr "團隊的放哨者"

msgid "Shapes in the Trees"
msgstr "樹林中的身影"

msgid "Eyes in the Dark"
msgstr "黑暗中的眼睛"

msgid "Each night, I was watched. I didn’t just feel watched: I saw the eyes peering out from the inky darkness that surrounded our camp. They knew we were there. The yellow eyes watched me, alert, my weapons drawn, ready to defend the camp if the need arose. Our eyes met, and a darkness seized my heart."
msgstr "每一個夜晚，我都受到監視。這並不是我的錯覺：我看見在營地的周圍，有許多雙眼睛從漆黑之中投來視線。它們知道我們在那裡。那些黃色的眼睛緊盯著我，我心生警惕，拔出自己的武器來準備保衛營地。就在目光相接之時，一片黑暗攫噬了我的心靈。"

msgid "Most of the nights passed without incident, but on this night, I was startled by the rustling of tree branches along the southern border of our camp’s clearing. Despite the darkness, I was able to use my binoculars to see shapes moving in the trees. The shapes appeared human, but...why? Why do they only watch us from afar? What is their purpose?"
msgstr "大多數夜晚都無驚無險地度過了，但今晚，營地空地的南邊傳來枝葉的沙沙聲，把我嚇了一跳。儘管身處黑夜，我還是能用雙筒望遠鏡看到樹林中移動的身影。那些身影看起來像人類，但……為什麼？他們為什麼要從遠處監視我們，他們有何目的？"

msgid "You earn 2 additional experience as you gain further insight into the motivations of the Eztli."
msgstr "你進一步了解埃茲特里人的動機，獲得2點額外的經驗點數。"

msgid "As the days went by, the poison continued to spread through my body. By the second night, my skin was drenched in sweat. I started having difficutly breathing, and I began every morning by retching up most of the previous night’s dinner."
msgstr "隨著時間的流逝，毒性在我的體內持續擴散。到了第二晚，汗水浸濕了我的皮膚。我呼吸變得十分困難，每天早晨起來，我幾乎都要將前一晚的晚餐吐出來。"
