msgid "Interlude III: The Jungle Beckons"
msgstr "幕間故事III：叢林的呼喚"

msgid "Once more, you venture south, leaving the safety of civilization behind. There is no time to waste. The path to the Nexus lies on familiar ground, not far from the previous expedition’s trail. Using the leather-bound journal as your guide, you retrace the expedition’s journey. Soon, you are deep within the jungle, surrounded on all sides by hazards—some natural, others bizarre…"
msgstr "沒時間耽擱了，於是你再一次前往南部，遠離安穩的文明世界。通往聯結點的道路就位於熟悉的地點，距離上次探險路線不遠。你將這本皮面日誌當作自己的嚮導，重新踏上那次探險的旅途。用不了多久，你便深入到危機四伏的叢林內部——除了自然環境的險惡之外，還有其他詭異的危險等待著你……"

Traveling by foot set you back several hours, but soon enough you reached the jungle once more."
msgstr "不幸的是，你的車子跑了約莫十幾英里來到雨林邊境，燃料已經用光了。由於時間緊張，你決定不返回補充燃料，而是接下來的旅途改以徒步行進。這花了你好幾個小時，但你很快就再次到達了這片叢林。"

msgstr "為尋找通往聯結點的道路，你穿行在叢林之中，所花的時間遠比你預想的更多，無暇捕獵或尋找更多的食糧。飢餓讓你無法思考，痛得像是在你胃裡錐了個洞。"

msgid "You begin the next scenario with 3 fewer resources."
msgstr "你開始下一場冒險時少3資源。"

msgstr "毒性仍在你體內擴散，破壞著你的五臟六腑。你的體溫一天高過一天，感覺自己像著了火一樣。你幾乎無法進食，身體的所有力氣彷彿都被抽空了。"

msgid "As you trudge through the lush jungle and pass a series of familiar overgrown temple ruins, your keen eye spots a pattern along the stone wall of the structure. Upon closer examination, you find that vines and caked dirt has hidden an elaborate carving of hieroglyphs."
msgstr "艱難地穿過茂密的叢林時，你經過許多荒蕪的神廟遺跡，它們看起來很熟悉，而你敏銳的雙眼發現了建築的石壁上帶有圖案。你湊近仔細觀察，在藤蔓和厚厚塵土的埋藏之下，發現了刻於石上密密麻麻的象形文字。"

msgstr "你拿出自己的水壺，在石壁上灑水，擦去塵土並讓堅硬的藤蔓更好清理。現在可以清楚地看到象形文字的圖案，儘管它的意義仍然成謎，但有六個象形文字重複出現，暗示著某些指示……"

msgid "Each investigator who has a canteen begins the next scenario with 1 clue <i>(from the token bank)</i>."
msgstr "每位帶有水壺的調查員在下一場冒險開始時帶有1個線索<i>(從供應堆拿取)</i>。"

"On the eve of your second night within the jungle, you and your companions sit in front of a dim campfire, keeping warm and trying to remain relaxed despite the task ahead of you. Ichtaca approaches the campfire and sits across from you. Her eyes are cast to the ground, and her shoulders sag with a burdensome weight. “I feel that I must apologize to you,” she admits, peering into the flickering fire. “You have proven yourselves to be both wise and formidable, and I have done nothing but command you and endanger you at every turn.” There is a long, peaceful pause between you. “Perhaps there is hope for humanity after all,” she says under her breath as she meets your gaze. Does she speak for you? Or for herself, as well?\n"
"Ichtaca rises to her feet after some time. “I trust you to take the first watch. Be on the lookout for serpents. They are surely on the lookout for us.” Your camp is quiet for the remainder of the night, but for the soothing crackling of the campfire and the choir of chirping insects whose singing fills the night air."

"在叢林度過的第二天傍晚，你和同伴們坐在黯淡的營火前取暖，並且試著讓自己放鬆下來，暫時忘卻自己將要面對的任務。伊塔卡來到營火前，坐在你旁邊。她望向地面，肩膀彷彿承受著莫大的重量一般沉了下來。“我得跟你說聲抱歉。”她凝視著搖曳的火焰，開始訴說，“你證明了自己的智慧與強大，而我除了向你發號施令，每每讓你陷入險境之外什麼忙都沒幫上。”一陣漫長而寂靜的沉默橫亙在你們兩人之間。“或許，人類還有希望。”她與你目光相接，壓低聲音說道。她是在對你說話嗎？還是說這句話也是對她自己說的？\n"
"過了一會，伊塔卡站起身來。“你先守夜吧，我信得過你。要戒備蛇族，它們肯定也在盯著我們。”你的營地在這晚接下來的時間裡都很寂靜，只剩下營火的劈啪聲，還有夜空裡齊聲和鳴的昆蟲唧喳聲，給你的內心帶來撫慰。"

msgid "In your Campaign Log, record that <i>Ichtaca’s faith is restored</i>. Add 1 [cultist] token to the chaos bag for the remainder of the campaign."
msgstr "在冒險日誌中，記錄下<i>伊塔卡重振信念</i>。將1個[cultist]標記加入混亂袋，持續到這個劇本結束。"
