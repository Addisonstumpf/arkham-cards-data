"At certain points throughout The Forgotten Age campaign, investigators are given the opportunity to choose supplies to bring on their expeditions into the wilds. These supplies are recorded in the Campaign Log, under each investigator’s “Supplies” section.\n"

"An investigator’s supplies will determine the possible options available during gameplay and throughout the story of this campaign. <b>Each supply has no effect on its own.</b> Some card effects, story options, and resolutions may change or become available depending on the supplies carried by the investigator(s)."

"Like <b>Victory X</b>, when an encounter card with <b>Vengeance X</b> is overcome by the investigators, it is stored in the victory display until the end of the scenario. However, unlike victory points, vengeance represents the awareness and animosity of the Father of Serpents, and it is generally a good idea to avoid accruing vengeance points whenever possible.\n"

msgid "<i>Example: Agenda 1a—“Expedition into the Wild” has the following ability: “[action]: <b>Explore.</b> Draw the top card of the exploration deck. If it is a connecting location, put it into play and move to it.” Ursula Downs is at the Expedition Camp and wishes to find a new location to travel to. She spends her first action to explore, drawing the top card of the exploration deck. The card she draws is Circuitous Trail. Because Circuitous Trail is a location that is not connected to the Expedition Camp, it is placed next to the exploration deck, and Ursula draws the next card in the exploration deck. This time, she draws the Low on Supplies treachery card, which she resolves as normal and places in the encounter discard pile. Her exploration is unsuccessful, and she must shuffle the Circuitous Trail that she drew previously back into the exploration deck. Ursula decides to explore one more time, spending a second action. This time, she draws Path of Thorns, which is connected to the Expedition Camp. Her exploration is successful. Path of Thorns is put into play with clues on it equal to its clue value, and Ursula immediately moves from the Expedition Camp to the Path of Thorns.</i>"
