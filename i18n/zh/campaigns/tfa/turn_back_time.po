"You stand in front of the main temple of the Eztli, sweat pouring down your skin due to the hot, damp jungle air. Stunned, you examine your surroundings. José and Maria stand next to you, gaping in wonder at the temple’s sophisticated architecture. Their packs are bulging with the extra supplies they were able to acquire from Alejandro’s contacts in Mexico City. Alejandro himself stands at the rear of the group, grinning.\n"
"Your consciousness has been snapped so far back that your mind aches from the force of it. Your body shudders, and you struggle to resist collapsing out of exhaustion. Though you have altered fate, your true task still remains ahead of you. As the rest of the expedition sets up camp and prepares to explore the ruins, you sneak off to fulfill your purpose, leaving Alejandro and the rest of your group behind. They wouldn’t understand. They haven’t seen what you have seen."

"你站在埃茲特里主神廟前方，叢林裡溫熱而潮濕的空氣使你渾身沁滿汗水。你查看周圍環境時感到震驚。何塞和瑪利亞就站在你旁邊，驚奇地看著神廟的精妙構成。他倆的背包裡裝滿了額外的補給品，那是通過亞歷山卓在墨西哥城的人脈獲得的。亞歷山卓獨自站在隊伍後方，咧嘴而笑。\n"
"你的意識被拉回如此久遠的地方，使你的大腦無力承受，痛苦不已。你的身體搖搖晃晃，竭力想要讓自己站穩腳跟，避免脫力倒下。雖然你已經改寫了命運，但你真正的任務仍然等待著你去完成。在其他探險隊員紮營，準備探索遺跡時，你為了完成自己的目的而悄悄溜走，離開了亞歷山卓和你的其他隊員。他們不會理解，因為他們未曾見過你所見的事物。"

"You stand near the main temple of the Eztli, sweat pouring down your skin due to the hot, damp jungle air. Stunned, you examine your surroundings. Several tents are set up in the clearing in front of the temple. José stands guard along the border of your camp, and you can see Maria packing equipment and provisions into her backpack, getting ready for her journey to the northern edge of the jungle, as you had instructed. Alejandro sits on a log in the center of the camp, decrypting the inscription he found near the temple’s entryway.\n"

"With your failure, the paradox of clashing timelines catches up to you. Despite all you have done, the events of the future cannot be unmade. You will always find the relic. You will always fail to preserve it. And the Nexus will always falter.\n"
"Reality as you know it will never be the same, but perhaps this is not the end of the world. After all, time is just one dimension: a dimension humanity barely understands. We experience time, but we cannot see it. We can measure it, but we cannot alter it. So what if the fourth dimension has split into hundreds of thousands of planes of existence? Our feeble human minds cannot comprehend the outcome, but the universe still survives, its ever-expanding boundaries no longer limited by the confines of time."

"隨著你的失敗，時間線衝突的矛盾使你遭受後果。不管你做了什麼，未來的種種事件都沒能改寫。你總能找到遺物，總是沒能保護好它，而聯結點定會變得衰弱。\n"
"你知道現世不會一成不變，但或許這不是世界末日。終究時間只是一種維度：一種人類幾乎不了解的維度。我們經歷時間，但卻看不見它；有辦法測量，但卻無法改變它。所以當第四維度被切分為成千上百個位面時，會發生什麼？我們人類的孱弱思維無法理解其後果，但宇宙仍然存在，其無限延伸的邊界不再受時間的桎梏。"

"No one else has ever learned of the events that truly occurred during the summer of 1925, and no one ever will, for I intend to keep this journal locked in my safe-deposit box once I have finished writing in it. I seek only to preserve my own record of these events, for I do not wish the passage of time to erase them completely. After all, these are not my memories, but the memories of my other self: the self who ventured through time and space to save humanity.\n"
"It is difficult to explain how we did what we did. After all that happened—Ichtaca, Alejandro, the city of the Yithians, Yoth—it turns out the true doom of humanity had occurred much, much earlier: when we first left to find the Eztli. We brought all of these events upon ourselves. In order to prevent this calamity, we had to seal the relic away forever. I remember these events as though I myself had experienced them, though for me, the expedition had gone much differently. We reached the central chamber of the Eztli ruins, but it was sealed shut, and nothing—not even the TNT that José had brought from the trucks—could breach the entrance. Although we returned to Arkham with proof that the Eztli existed, no other expedition would ever find them or their ruins again. My other self perished in those ruins—but I remember. Somehow, I remember everything."

"我決定在我寫完這本日誌，將1925年夏天真實發生的種種事件記錄完畢時，將這本日誌鎖在我的保險箱裡，再沒別人知曉，也不會有人知曉這一切。我不希望時間的流逝將這些事件通通抹去，所以只能想辦法保留自己的記錄。說到底，這些並不是我的記憶，而是“另一個我”的記憶：那個為了拯救人類而勇闖時空的我。\n"
"很難解釋我是怎麼做到那些事情的。在那一切發生之後——伊塔卡、亞歷山卓、伊斯人的城市、幽嘶——人類真正的末日來得要更早，我們第一次出發尋找埃茲特里的時候便已到來。這一切的事件都是我們自己引起的。為了阻止這場災難，我們必須將遺物永遠封印起來。我清楚地記得這些事件，就像我曾親身經歷一樣，儘管對我來說，這次探險的結果大不相同。我們到達了埃茲特里遺跡的中央石室，但這石室已被封印並關閉，什麼東西都沒法打開這道石門——即使是何塞從卡車帶來的TNT炸藥也不行。儘管我們帶著埃茲特里曾經存在的證據回到了阿卡姆，但再也沒有其他探險隊能夠找到埃茲特里人，或是埃茲特里遺跡。另一個我在那遺跡裡死去——但我還記得他所經歷的一切。不知道為什麼，我一切都記得。"
