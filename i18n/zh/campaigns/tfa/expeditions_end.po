"We have finally made it back to Arkham, our expedition a “success.” Alejandro is excited to report his findings to the university. How he maintains his starry-eyed idealism after the hell we went through in the jungle is beyond me. His attention is fixated on the strange relic that we discovered in the ruins. I wish we knew a little more about the artifact’s origins. It unsettles me greatly. It hums at all times and pulses with an otherworldly energy I can scarcely describe. As we traveled home with the artifact in tow, our nights were plagued by bizarre nightmares: dreams of other worlds and civilizations.\n"
"Alejandro wants to bring the relic to the Miskatonic Museum, to put on display along with the other Eztli artifacts we discovered. My feelings are mixed. At the museum, it will receive proper care, and historians will be able to study it and perhaps even discern its purpose. However, I fear that the relic may be too dangerous for the public. After all, we still have no idea what the damned thing even is. Alejandro would hate it, but perhaps it would be better to keep the relic somewhere safe, where Harlan and I can study it in private. I’ll have to decide tonight; after tomorrow, there won’t be time to change my mind..."

"我們終於成功回到了阿卡姆，這次探險“成功”了。亞歷山卓要向大學匯報自己的發現，他為此激動不已。我不理解他為什麼在經過叢林的遭遇之後，還能繼續滿懷熱誠、雙目放光地堅持自己的理想主義。他專注於我們從遺跡裡找到的那件古怪遺物，但願我們能對它的起源有多一些了解。它使我心神激盪，難以平靜。它一直嗡嗡作響，伴隨著我難以描述的超於現世的能量而搏動著。自從我們帶著這件遺物回來之後，每晚都被怪異的噩夢所折磨，我們在夢裡看到了其他的世界和文明。\n"
"亞歷山卓要我將這件遺物帶回米斯卡塔尼克博物館，和我們發現的其他埃茲特里遺物一同展示。我百感交集。它會在博物館裡得到妥善的保管，可供歷史學家研究，甚至可能得知它的用途。但是，我擔心這件遺物公開展示可能過於危險。我們仍然不知道這該死的東西究竟是什麼。或許應該將這個遺物存放在安全的地方，以供我和哈倫私下對它研究，但我猜亞歷山卓不喜歡這樣。今晚我就得做決定；在明天之後，就沒時間改變主意了……"

"I’ve decided to give custody of the relic to Alejandro. This entire expedition was based on his research, after all—he should be the one to study it. If anyone can discover the relic’s secrets, it’s him.\n"
"The relic is to be the centerpiece of a new exhibit at the museum. Alejandro has already written extensively about our discoveries, but his work has only just begun. Many mysteries about our expedition remain. How have the Eztli people remained undiscovered for so long? Why did they appear to be guarding the jungle, and from what? Who really built the temple ruins we explored? I have no doubt Alejandro will uncover the answers to these questions, given enough time.\n"
"As for me, my role in this endeavor has ended. However, I have yet to relax. My thoughts are constantly in the jungle—serpentine figures in the shadows, obsidian arrows embedded in skeletal bodies, malformed voices shrieking in the cavernous depths. When I walk through the streets, I find myself drawn toward the museum without realizing it, as though possessed to see the relic once again. There is a nagging sensation in the back of my mind, as though we have forgotten something important. What must I do to rid myself of—\n"

"我決定將這件遺物交給亞歷山卓保管。說到底，這整場探險都是為他的研究服務的——應該由他來研究這東西。要是有人能夠發現這件遺物的秘密，那準是他。\n"
"這件遺物將成為博物館新展覽的核心展品。亞歷山卓已經為我們的發現費了不少筆墨，但他的研究才剛剛開始。我們的探險之旅仍有不少未知之謎。埃茲特里人為什麼這麼久都未被發現？他們似乎在保衛叢林，是出於什麼目的？叢林又是為什麼需要保衛呢？我們探索的神廟遺跡到底是誰建造的？我相信如果時間足夠，亞歷山卓定能找出這些問題的答案。\n"
"至於我，這件事我已經幫不上忙了。可是，我還是放鬆不下來。我的思緒始終停留在叢林裡——陰影中的蛇形生物、嵌入屍骨中的黑曜石箭枝，從洞穴深處傳來失真的尖叫聲。我走過一條條街道時，發現自己竟渾然不覺地向著博物館的方向走去，就像著了魔一樣想要再看那遺物一眼。我腦海中有種感覺揮之不去，似乎我們忘了某些重要的事情。我得讓自己擺脫那——\n"

"I’ve decided to keep the relic hidden for now. Alejandro is not happy with my decision, but until we know what the orb is capable of, it’s important that it stay somewhere safe, where it won’t endanger others. Harlan agrees with me, and has offered to take custody of the relic and keep it in his private office. There, we can study the artifact in secret.\n"
"Alejandro is staying in Arkham for the time being, recording his notes about the expedition and helping the museum put together an exhibit displaying our other, less dangerous discoveries. As for me, I hope to find answers to other mysteries: How have the Eztli people remained undiscovered for so long? Why did they appear to be guarding the jungle, and from what? Who really built the temple ruins we explored?\n"

"我決定暫時保管這件遺物。亞歷山卓對我的決定並不滿意，但是只要我們還不知道這個鋼球的作用，它就必須放在穩妥的地方，以免危及他人的安全。哈倫同意我的決定，提出由他來保管遺物，並存放到他的私人辦公室。我們就在那兒秘密研究這件遺物。\n"
"亞歷山卓暫時住在阿卡姆，將本次探險的經歷作記錄，並幫助博物館將我們找到的危害性較低的其他遺物一同展出。至於我，我希望找到其他謎團的答案：埃茲特里人為什麼這麼久都未被發現？他們似乎在保衛叢林，是出於什麼目的？叢林又是為什麼需要保衛呢？我們探索的神廟遺跡到底是誰建造的？\n"

"You drop your pen as a loud knocking at the door startles you, and you jump to your feet. It is almost 2:30 in the morning. Who could possibly be at your door at this hour? Your thoughts wander again to the jungle, and you are faced with a vision of serpent-creatures attacking you in your own home. Shuddering, you find a weapon and approach the front door carefully, ready to strike if need be. You take a long breath and open the door.\n"
"On the other side is a familiar woman with brown skin, long brown hair, and piercing yellow eyes set in a hard glare. Though her attire has changed, you recognize her instantly as Ichtaca, the Eztli warrior you encountered in the rainforest. Wearing a long coat and a Bollman hat, she is visibly uncomfortable in her shoes. Her jaw is set in anger. You are about to raise your weapon in defense when she lets out a heavy sigh and walks slowly over the threshold of your home, shutting your front door behind her. “Whatever you did, you have to reverse it,” she intones darkly. “Or we will all cease to exist.”"

"一陣響亮的敲門聲把你嚇了一跳，手裡的鋼筆都掉到了地上。這時臨近凌晨2:30。誰會在這個時間來敲你的門呢？你的思緒再次飄回了叢林，腦海中浮現了一個景象：蛇人來到你的家中攻擊你。你戰戰兢兢，找出一件武器並小心地走近前門，做好了攻擊的準備，以防萬一。你深吸一口氣，把門打開。\n"
"門的另一邊是一位熟悉的女士，有著古銅色皮膚，棕色長捲髮，她一雙金色的明眸目光銳利，怒目圓睜。儘管她換了一身穿著，你還是立即認出了她——伊塔卡，你在叢林裡遇到的埃茲特里戰士。她穿著一件長大衣，戴著一頂博爾曼帽子，很顯然她穿著鞋子不太自在。她怒不可遏。你正準備舉起武器防禦的時候，她重重地嘆了一口氣，慢步走進你家並關上了前門。“不管你做了什麼，你必須得將它逆轉，”她用陰鬱的口吻說道，“否則我們都將不復存在。”"

"Harlan Earnstone paces across your living room, dabbing his wrinkled forehead with his handkerchief. “It’s my fault. I should never have encouraged them to go on that dreadful expedition.” Though your paths have only crossed a few times before, Mr. Earnstone has become a valuable contact of yours within Miskatonic University. When the University’s latest expedition returned with only a few survivors and a handful of strange, archaic artifacts, he came to you for advice.\n"
"“I know, I know. I should at least take solace in the fact that the expedition was successful, despite its heavy losses. Alejandro was right all along. The Eztli people are real. And yet...I am concerned about some of these findings.” Harlan pulls a small leather-bound journal from his suitcase and hands it to you. “Before the expedition leader’s tragic death, the leader recorded many of the group’s discoveries in this journal. One of the surviving members of the expedition managed to grab it from the camp before fleeing the jungle. I think if you read these entries, you’ll understand what I mean. The things they experienced, the creatures they encountered...” Harlan shudders and adjusts his glasses with too-shaky hands. “I am concerned not only for Alejandro, but for all of us. Read this journal, and if you can, please keep an eye on my colleague.” You agree to help, but his worry does not fade. “I only hope that I am not damning you to a similar fate by asking for your aid.”\n"
"You spend the remainder of that night studying the expedition journal, your mind swimming with thoughts of strange serpent-creatures and Aztec warriors. Long after Harlan has left, a loud knocking at the door startles you, and you jump to your feet. It is almost 2:30 in the morning. Who could possibly be at your door at this hour? You open the front door warily. On the other side is a woman with brown skin, long brown hair, and piercing yellow eyes set in a hard glare. She wears a long coat and a Bollman-style hat, visibly uncomfortable in her shoes. Her jaw is set in anger. A sudden flash of insight crosses your mind, and you realize at once who she must be. After all, you’ve read and re-read the journal’s description of Ichtaca, the Eztli warrior. She lets out a heavy sigh and walks slowly over the threshold of your home, shutting your front door behind her. “Whatever they did, you have to reverse it,” she intones darkly. “Or we will all cease to exist.”"

"哈倫·恩斯通走進了你的起居室，用他的手帕擦拭著滿佈皺紋的前額。“是我的錯。我不該鼓動他們參加這場凶險的探險。”儘管你們只有寥寥幾次交集，恩斯通先生已成為你在米斯卡塔尼克大學重要的聯絡人。最近這場探險只有幾人倖免於難，帶回了幾件怪異的古代遺物，所以他前來尋求你的建議。\n"
"“我知道，我知道。這次探險儘管損傷慘重，但是成功了，這最終的結果至少可以讓我聊以自慰。亞歷山卓說的沒錯，埃茲特里人是真實存在的，而且存在至今……我擔心其中的一些發現會引起恐慌。哈倫從自己的手提箱裡拿出一本皮面的日誌，遞給你。“在探險隊隊長壯烈犧牲之前，他將隊伍的發現都記在了這本日誌裡。探險隊的其中一位倖存者趕在逃出叢林之前，從營地裡找出了這本日誌。我想，你要是讀了這些日誌，你會明白我的意思。他們的經歷，還有他們遭遇的那些生物……”哈倫渾身發抖，用顫抖的雙手扶著自己的眼鏡。“我擔心的不只是亞歷山卓一人，而是我們所有人。讀一讀這本日誌，還有，如果可以的話，請留心我的這位同事。”你答應幫他的忙，但他的憂慮並未消減。“我只希望我請你幫忙的這件事，不要害你遇上相同的命運。”\n"
"在這晚接下來的時間裡，你都在研讀探險隊的日誌，你的思緒在古怪的蛇人和阿茲特克的戰士之間游移。哈倫離開之後過了很久，一陣響亮的敲門聲把你嚇了一跳。這時臨近凌晨2:30。誰會在這個時間來敲你的門呢？你謹慎地打開了前門。門的另一邊是一位女士，有著古銅色的皮膚，棕色長捲髮，她一雙金色的明眸目光銳利，怒目圓睜。她穿著一件長大衣，戴著一頂博爾曼帽子，很顯然她穿著鞋子不太自在。她怒不可遏。你的腦中突然靈光一閃，你馬上認出了她是誰。畢竟你把日誌裡對埃茲特里戰士伊塔卡的描述讀了一遍又一遍。她重重地嘆了一口氣，慢步走進你家並關上了前門。“不管他們做了什麼，你必須得將它逆轉，”她用陰鬱的口吻說道，“否則我們都將不復存在。”"
