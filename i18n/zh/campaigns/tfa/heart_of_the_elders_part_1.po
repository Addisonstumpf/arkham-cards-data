"It has been several days since your party ventured forth into the rainforest once more, and each day, the hazards you face grow more dangerous and frequent. Securing enough food and supplies for the journey is a constant struggle, and you are harrassed at every turn by the jungle’s inhabitants. Fortunately, you have seen no sign yet of the serpent people who attacked the previous expedition, but you’re positive they are out there. Watching. Waiting.\n"
"On the morning of the sixth day, you find the entrance. It is a huge cave opening, partially obscured by trees, brush, and vines. You nearly missed the great cavern maw altogether, despite its enormity. Surrounding the cavern’s entrance are six stone pillars, each covered in strange grooves and carvings that glow with a dim red hue. Perhaps one of your guides will understand what this means?"

"自從你的隊伍再次進入叢林探險以來，已經過了好幾天，你們愈發頻繁地遭遇危機，危險程度也與日俱增。努力保障此次旅程的食糧和補給品數量充足，這已經不容易，更別提還時常受到叢林住民的滋擾。萬幸的是，你至今還沒發現上次探險來襲的蛇族的蹤跡，但你確定它們就在那裡。它們在盯著你們，伺機而動。\n"
"在第六天的早晨，你找到了入口。這是一個巨大的洞穴入口，被樹木、灌木叢和藤蔓遮擋著。你差點完全錯過了這整個巨大的洞穴入口，儘管它是如此地龐大。洞穴入口周圍的是六根石柱，每根石柱均覆蓋著古怪的凹槽和閃著黯淡紅光的雕文。或許你的嚮導之中有人會知道這是什麼含義？"

msgid "“The entrance is warded against intruders,” Ichtaca says cryptically, her eyes closed as though probing the cavern with unnatural senses. “These pillars are the key. Each is a test of wit and will.” She steps toward one of them and touches it with her palm, and its glow brightens. You notice now that the grooves along the pillar’s foundation depict a pattern you have seen somewhere before. If Ichtaca believes this place to be warded, you trust her opinion—there must be some way to break these wards…"
msgstr "“那個入口有人把守，防止入侵者進入。”伊塔卡神祕地說道，合上雙眼，彷彿用靈感來探索整個洞穴一般，“這些柱子就是鑰匙。每根石柱都代表著一次對智慧和意志的考驗。”她向其中一根柱子踏近一步並伸出手掌觸碰，柱身的光芒開始變亮。你發現這根柱子底下帶有的凹槽形成一種圖案，你曾在某個地方見過這圖案。伊塔卡認為此地有人把守，如果你認同她的觀點——必須得找到別的方法才能進去……"

msgid "Begin this scenario with Ichtaca in play."
msgstr "本場冒險開始時，將伊塔卡放置在場。"

msgid "Alejandro examines each of the pillars studiously. “It is a lock of some sort. Look here, see? The grooves do not line up perfectly.” He twists one of the pillars, and you can see the pattern along its side shifting. “I wager if we entered the cave, we would not get very far without these pillars in the correct formation. Just a hunch, I suppose…But I think we should examine this area further before we proceed.” You know Alejandro well enough by now to know that his hunches tend to be correct."
msgstr "亞歷山卓仔細地查看每根石柱。 “這些柱子的作用應該和門鎖差不多。看這兒，看到了嗎？凹槽沒有剛好連成一線。”他轉動其中一根石柱，隨後你看見石柱向側轉動時顯示的圖案。“我敢打賭，要是沒有把這些石柱正確排列就進洞的話，我們是走不遠的。這只是我的直覺……但我認為我們應該更加仔細地檢查這個區域，再進入洞穴。”你現在很了解亞歷山卓，知道他的直覺往往是對的。"

msgid "Begin this scenario with Alejandro Vela in play."
msgstr "本場冒險開始時，將亞歷山卓·維拉放置在場。"

msgid "The previous expedition’s journal doesn’t have all the answers, but as you browse its pages, you are struck by a familiar diagram—one drawn by Lorenzo, an expedition member who never made it back to Arkham. It is a delicate recreation of a carving that was on the wall of one of the Eztli ruins. Many of the patterns and hieroglyphs you see in this drawing are shared among these pillars. It cannot simply be a coincidence. These pillars are surely the key to finding your way to N’kai…"
msgstr "在上一次探險的日誌內並不能找到所有的答案，但當你翻動書頁的時候，一個熟悉的圖樣吸引了你的注意力——由此前喪生的探險隊員洛倫佐所繪製的一個圖樣。這是從其中一處埃茲特里遺跡的石壁上細緻摹畫的雕紋。你從摹畫下來的圖樣忠看到了許多圖案和象形文字，與這些石柱上的一致。這部是個單純的巧合。這些石柱無疑就是關鍵，能夠令你找到恩凱之路……"
