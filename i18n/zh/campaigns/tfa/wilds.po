"It’s been a hell of a day. We’ve just set up camp along the northern border of the rainforest where Alejandro believes the Eztli once dwelled. The jungle here is dense and untamed. The sky hides above the tree cover, but I can tell from the crisp breeze that storm clouds are brewing overhead.\n"
"The dangers of our expedition have been explained to us many times. We are hundreds of miles away from any sign of civilization. Nobody in modern times has yet to pierce the heart of these wilds. Until now, nobody has had reason to try. After all, it wouldn’t make sense to find Aztec ruins in this region of Mexico. And yet, here we are: looking for ruins that may not exist in a place where, by all accounts, they should not.\n"
"Already one of our surveyors has fallen ill, and another has been bitten by a viper. I’m starting to think the rainforest doesn’t want us here. If this luck persists, ours will be the shortest expedition in Miskatonic University’s history. Tonight, we rest. Tomorrow, we venture into uncharted wilds."

"今天真是糟透了。我們剛剛才在叢林南部邊境紮好營，這兒就是亞歷山卓深信埃茲特里曾經存在的地方。這片叢林生長茂密，充滿野性。樹冠遮蓋了天空，但從這清爽的微風看來，我敢肯定頭上正積聚著烏雲。\n"
"我們曾多次被告知本次探險的危險性。這裡遠離文明的跡象已有幾百英里，當代還沒人踏入過這片狂野之地的腹地。直至現在，也沒有人有理由去作這一嘗試。畢竟，墨西哥的這個區域根本不應該存在阿茲特克遺跡。但現在我們到此尋找遺跡，儘管大家都說它不可能存在於此。\n"
"我們的一位測量員已疾病纏身，而另一位則被毒蛇咬傷。我不禁覺得，叢林不希望我們在此出現。要是運氣一直這麼糟，我們這次探險恐怕要成米斯卡塔尼克大學史上最短的探險了。今晚我們先作休整，明天便要步入這片神秘的野地探險了。"

"I still have no idea how we made it back to camp alive.\n"
"The jungle was more perilous than we could have possibly imagined. This may read like the ravings of a lunatic, but I cannot explain it any other way. Being lost in the jungle was no picnic, but that was the least of our worries. The rainforest was guarded. Guarded by unfathomable horrors: serpentine creatures driven by anger and hate, hunting us relentlessly.\n"
"Perhaps just as deadly were the human natives of the rainforest. They appeared to be Aztec warriors as far as dress and speech were concerned. Despite the conquering of the Aztec people hundreds of years ago, these warriors somehow survived. How they managed to remain undiscovered this long is beyond us. I thought Alejandro would be excited to learn more about them, but he was more disturbed than fascinated. I suppose he has a right to be incredulous. Nothing about this expedition makes sense.\n"
"The serpent creatures chased us for what seemed like days. Finally we were able to find our way back to camp, but the price was steep. We had lost all progress we had made, and many of us were injured or afflicted by serpent venom. We have no choice but to send runners to the nearest city for additional supplies and to wait and recover from our wounds."

"我完全不知道我是怎麼活著回到營地的。\n"
"叢林的險惡遠遠超出我們的想像。這聽起來就像瘋子的胡話，但我沒法以別的方式解釋這件事。我們在叢林裡迷了路，大費周章才回到正途，但與別的事相比，迷路根本算不上什麼。叢林“有人看守”，看守者是深不可測的恐怖存在：這些蛇人被憤怒和仇恨所驅使，無情地追捕我們。\n"
"或許跟它們一樣可怕的，還有叢林中的原住民。從衣著和談吐來看，他們像是阿茲特克的戰士。阿茲特克人早在數百年前便被征服，但這些戰士們卻不知何故存活至今。他們為什麼幾個世紀都沒被發現？我們實在想不到答案。我本以為亞歷山卓準會為此興奮不已，想要更加瞭解他們。然而他實際上卻十分不安，一洗先前那副陶醉的神情。畢竟這次探險盡是些不合常理的怪事，他確實有理由懷疑。\n"
"一群蛇人大概追了我們好幾天，最終我們找到了返回營地的路，但付出的代價十分慘痛。探險至今為止的進展全都化為泡影，隊伍裡的好些成員都受了傷，或受蛇毒折磨。我們別無選擇，只能派幾個人跑到最近的城市再去拿些補給品，等傷員恢復。"

"Somehow, after much toil and many hours of exploration, we found the ruins that Alejandro sought, though we scarcely could have been ready for what we encountered in the wilds of the jungle. The rainforest was guarded. Guarded by unfathomable horrors: serpentine creatures driven by anger and hate. They hunted us relentlessly, wielding primitive weaponry and communicating in sharp hisses.\n"
"Perhaps just as deadly were the human natives of the rainforest. They appeared to be Aztec warriors as far as dress and speech were concerned. Despite the conquering of the Aztec people hundreds of years ago, these warriors somehow survived. How they managed to remain undiscovered this long is beyond us. The warrior named Ichtaca was particularly intriguing. We were able to defuse the initial encounter with her, and surprisingly, she helped guide us through the jungle, only to disappear mysteriously when we reached the ruins. I have a feeling we have not seen the last of her.\n"
"Alejandro did not agree with our decision to trust the Eztli warriors. He’s decided to stay at camp until further notice, disturbed as he is by their presence. I thought he would be excited to learn more about them, but I expect this discovery defies even his broad-minded theories. I suppose he has a right to be distrustful. Nothing about this expedition makes sense.\n"
"We have cleared a route to what Alejandro believes is the main temple of the ruins. There is little time to rest. The serpent creatures seem intent on stopping us, so we cannot tarry any longer than necessary. Soon we will enter the ruins to see what secrets they hide."

"不知怎地，在歷盡艱辛和數小時的探索之後，我們找到了亞歷山卓苦苦找尋的遺跡，儘管我們未曾想在這片荒野叢林之中有此遭遇。叢林“有人看守”，看守者是深不可測的恐怖存在：被憤怒和仇恨所驅使的蛇人。它們無情地追趕我們，運用原始的武器，以嘶嘶的叫聲互相交流。\n"
"或許跟它們一樣可怕的，還有叢林中的原住民。從衣著和談吐來看，他們像是阿茲特克的戰士。阿茲特克人早在數百年前便被征服，但這些戰士們卻不知何故存活至今。他們為什麼幾個世紀都沒被發現？我們實在想不到答案。那個名叫伊塔卡的戰士尤其神秘。我們在初次遭遇她時成功解除了她的敵意，令人吃驚的是她指引我們通過了叢林。但當我們到達遺跡時，她卻神秘地消失了。我有種感覺，我們還會再次見到她。\n"
"我們提議相信埃茲特里的戰士們，而亞歷山卓對此並不贊同。他決定留在營地等待進一步消息，戰士們在場使他煩惱焦躁。我本以為他準會興奮地想要更加瞭解他們，但我猜想這一發現甚至與他博大精深的理論相悖。畢竟這次探險盡是些不合常理的怪事，他確實有理由懷疑。\n"
"我們清出了一條道路，通向亞歷山卓相信遺跡主神廟所在的地方。一群蛇形生物似乎要阻止我們進入此地，因此我們一刻也不能耽擱，幾乎沒時間休整隊伍。很快我們就會進入遺跡，看看它們到底藏著什麼秘密。"
