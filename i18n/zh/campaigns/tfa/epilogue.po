msgid "There is only one way to stop all of this from ever happening. Before you arrived and set all of these events into motion, the Eztli ruins were asleep, and the relic was relatively safe in its prison of obscurity. Had it not been for Alejandro’s desire to find it, it might have remained undiscovered for centuries. With your new understanding of the relic’s capabilities, you can return to the past and set things right. You can seal it away forever and prevent your past selves from having ever found it… even if it costs you your own life."
msgstr "要阻止這一切的發生，只有一種辦法。在你到達並引起這些事件之前，埃茲特里遺跡仍在沉睡中，而遺物待在其昏暗的牢籠之中相對地安全。如果不是亞歷山卓渴望找到它，它可能在經過幾個世紀之後仍未被發現。因為你對遺物的能力有了新的理解，你現在能夠回到過去，讓一切回到正軌。你可以將這遺物永遠封印，防止過去的你找到它……即便要付出生命的代價也在所不惜。"
