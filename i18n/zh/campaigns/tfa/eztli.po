"Our runners, José and Maria, returned several days later. They were fully stocked with food, water, aspirin, and weapons. I am curious how deep Alejandro’s connections are in Mexico. For an outcast historian, he was able to secure guns and ammunition faster than I had anticipated. But perhaps it is better if he keeps his sources undisclosed.\n"
"We ventured once more into the jungle. This time, we were prepared. We had learned from our previous excursion, and we made our way across the river canyon, venturing deeper south than we had dared before. Eventually we reached the ruins Alejandro sought, and soon we will enter what Alejandro believes is the main temple. Strangely, the serpent creatures we encountered earlier didn’t attack in force as we had feared. Could they have fled? Or are they simply lying in wait, preparing to ambush while we sleep at night?"

"派出去取補給品的何塞和瑪利亞在幾天後回來了。他們帶回了滿滿的食物、水、阿司匹林、武器。我很好奇亞歷山卓在墨西哥究竟有著多深厚的人脈關係。作為一個被學界驅逐的歷史學家，他搞到槍枝和彈藥的速度之快，超出了我的預期。不過，這些東西的來路，或許別人還是不知道為好。\n"
"我們再次進入叢林探險。這一次，我們做足了準備，從上次經歷中汲取教訓，穿過河谷，向之前不敢進入的南部更深處進發。最終我們來到了亞歷山卓苦苦找尋的遺跡，馬上就要進入遺跡內部，亞歷山卓認為主神廟就在這裡。奇怪的是，我們害怕的事情並未發生，早前遇到的蛇人並未來襲。它們逃走了嗎？還是說它們只是在等待，準備在晚上我們睡下的時後發動突襲？"

"We spent most of yesterday moving our camp to the edge of the ruins. With the serpentine creatures still guarding the region, we have decided that a small party will have the best chance of slipping into the main temple unnoticed. I told Maria, the expedition’s naturalist, to take one of the trucks and wait beyond the northern edge of the rainforest. Our cartographer, José, is guarding the camp until we return. We’re on our own, but at least we’ve cleared an escape route in the event things go sour…"

"我們昨天幾乎花了一整天來轉移營地，在遺跡邊上紮營。蛇人仍然保衛著這片區域，為了悄聲無息地潛入主神廟，我們決定派出一支精銳小隊。我告訴探險隊中的博物學家瑪利亞，要她開一輛卡車，到叢林北面的邊境之外等候。我們的製圖專家何塞則負責保衛營地，直到我們回來。我們只能靠自己，但以防情況變糟，我們還清出了一條逃生路線……"

"The outside of the temple ruins appeared Aztec in origin, but once we breached the interior, it became clear that these buildings had a very different and inhuman origin. The ruins were alive. The grooves in the walls were illuminated as though powered by electricity, and a faint hum of energy reverberated throughout the halls. In spite of the serpent creatures, we were able to reach a hidden passage that led deeper underground.\n"
"In the central chamber of these underground halls, we found our prize: a steel orb of unknown origin, gently humming and glowing with a dim blue light. It was attached delicately to a bronze frame, appearing almost religious in its significance, and we knew it could not have been made by the Aztecs.\n"
"With the artifact in tow, we fled the ruins. The building had started to crumble around us, as though the orb was the only thing keeping it standing. Had it been powering the ruins, like a battery? What exactly was this device that the serpents guarded so fervently?\n"
"Maria was waiting for us with the trucks when we finally reached the northern edge of the rainforest. We’re getting the hell out of this serpent-infested jungle while we still can."

"神廟遺跡外部看起來像是阿茲特克風格，但當我們進入建築內部時，我們發現這些建築的起源顯然不同於阿茲特克，而是起源於非人種族。這些遺跡還“活”著。如同電力驅動一般，牆壁上的凹槽發出光芒，一陣低沉的能量嗡嗡聲在各個廳室中迴盪。儘管蛇人百般阻撓，我們還是開啟了一條秘密通道，通向更深的地下。\n"
"在諸多地下廳室的中央石室裡，我們找到了自己的戰利品：一個發出輕微的嗡嗡聲、包裹在暗淡藍光中的神祕鋼球。這個球被精心嵌入一個青銅支架裡面，似乎具有宗教意義，我們認為它不可能是阿茲特克人所製。\n"
"我們帶著遺物逃出了遺跡。這座建築開始劇震，彷彿它是依靠這個球才得以維持存在的。是這個球在為遺跡供能嗎，像電池一樣？得到眾蛇保護的這件遺物究竟是什麼？\n"
"我們終於到達了叢林北部邊境，瑪利亞和卡車就在這等著我們。趁還來得及，我們得抓緊逃出這片蛇群出沒的叢林。"

"It is not in my nature to leave a thing unfinished. For the sake of my fallen comrades, I have taken it upon myself to record the remainder of our expedition in this journal.\n"
"The others never made it out of the temple. I convinced two of the other members of the expedition, José and Andrea, to venture in after the others…But now I fear a terrible fate has befallen them, as well.\n"
"Thankfully, my gambit was worthwhile. While José and Andrea searched for the others, I snuck into the temple and took a different route. Having seen what we have seen, knowing what we know now, I couldn’t have returned to the university without evidence of our discovery. While the serpent creatures were distracted, I was able to reach a hidden passageway that led deeper underground.\n"
"In the central chamber of these underground halls, I found the device. The orb was made of an unnatural steel, attached delicately to its bronze frame. It pulsed with power in my hands and glowed with a dim blue light. Any fool could tell that it was not made by the Aztecs, but the other members of the expedition could not even begin to understand its true significance. The ruins started to crumble around me as I left, but it mattered not. The relic was all that mattered now.\n"
"With the artifact in tow, I returned to camp and told the others it was time to depart. Maria was waiting for us with the trucks when we finally reached the northern edge of the jungle. Now we are headed to Texas, where we will cross the border into the United States.\n"

"半途而廢不是我的作風。為了我死去的同伴，我決定自己在這本日誌上記錄接下來的探險。\n"
"其他人沒能活著逃出神殿。我說服了探險隊的另外兩名成員，何塞和安德里亞。讓他們進去尋找其他人……但我擔心他們也遭逢了同樣的厄運。\n"
"謝天謝地，我的策略奏效了。當何塞和安德里亞搜尋他人時，我偷偷溜進神廟，沿著另一條路線走。我親眼目睹，知道了那些事情，現在必須找到證據以作證明，才能返回大學。趁著蛇人在注意別處之際，我來到了一條秘密通道，通往更深的地下。\n"
"在諸多地下廳室的中央石室裡，我找到了一件遺物。這個球體是由非天然的鋼鐵製成，精巧地安裝在青銅支架上。它在我手中有力地搏動，發出暗淡的藍色光芒。傻子都知道它不是阿茲特克人製造出來的，但探險隊的其他隊員還不了解它真正的意義。在我離開的時候，我周圍的遺跡開始晃動，但這不打緊，那個遺物是現在唯一要緊的東西。\n"
"我拖著這個遺物返回了營地，讓其他隊員立刻撤離。我們終於到達了叢林北部邊境，瑪利亞和卡車就在這等著我們。現在我們得穿過邊境進入美國，前往德克薩斯州。\n"
"很遺憾在別的隊員身上發生了這樣的事。他們不會白白犧牲的。現在，我可以繼續研究了。\n"

"This was a mistake. This was all a terrible mistake. We escaped the temple with our lives, but not a moment too soon. The ruins were alive. It was as though the walls knew of our intrusion, hated us for our presence. Wanted us out. Wanted us dead.\n"

"We made our decision. There was no way we were going back into that deathtrap. Thankfully, there was another way. José had brought some TNT from the trucks, and there was more than enough to level the damned place.\n"
"That night, we put on a hell of a fireworks show. The jungle protested. Birds scattered into the sky, the ground rumbled, and hateful snarls surrounded our camp. But the dynamite did its job. Once the dust settled, we began sifting through the debris in search of anything with historical or cultural significance we could bring back to Arkham.\n"
"José was the first to notice the blue light peeking out from underneath the remains of the temple. The rays grew in intensity with each passing moment. As we started clearing the rubble in order to discover the source of the light, there was a sudden flash, and the debris at the center of the ruins scattered. A steel orb of unknown origin lay on top of the rubble, gently humming. It was attached delicately to a bronze frame, appearing almost religious in its significance. The blue glow emanating from the device dimmed as I touched it. There was no way a device like this was built by the Aztecs.\n"
"With the artifact in tow, we left the smoldering temple behind us. We had outstayed our welcome in this rainforest, and we knew it. Around us, the jungle hissed. The ground slithered and crawled with snakes. In the darkness, we heard shouts in a language we could not understand. There was no time to pack up camp; we ran as soon as we had the chance. Andrea was struck in her throat by a black-feathered arrow, her startled scream captured in grim perpetuity. José was grabbed by a giant boa as we fled north into the river canyon. His neck snapped before we could reach him.\n"
"Maria was waiting for us with the trucks when we finally reached the northern edge of the jungle. We didn’t stop until we crossed into Mexico City. Even now I do not feel safe: who could, after seeing what we have seen?\n"

"我們做出了決定。我們不能回去那座危險的建築中。值得慶幸的是，還有另一種辦法。何塞從卡車裡拿出了一些TNT炸藥，足夠將這個該死的地方夷為平地。\n"
"當天夜裡，我們簡直是搞了一場煙火秀。叢林對此舉十分抗拒，鳥群受驚飛向天空，地面震動不已，我們的營地周圍充斥著憤恨的嚎叫。但炸藥發揮了效用，將建築炸毀。當塵埃落定，我們開始在廢墟中搜，找具有歷史或文化意義的東西，好像我們帶回阿卡姆。\n"
"何塞最先發現了神廟殘垣下發出的藍色光芒。光芒隨著時間流逝而愈發強烈。當我們開始清理碎石，以便找到光芒的來源時，突然一道閃光，遺跡中央的廢墟四散開來。一個來歷不明的鋼球位於碎石堆頂上，發出輕微的嗡嗡聲。這個球被精心嵌入一個青銅支架裡面，似乎具有宗教意義。當我觸碰它的時候，從這件遺物中發出了暗淡的藍色光芒。這樣的遺物不可能是阿茲特克人製造出來的。\n"
"我們拖著這個遺物逃出了遺跡，將還冒著青煙的神廟拋在身後。我們在叢林已逗留太久，我們自己也清楚地知道這一點。在我們周圍，整個叢林充斥著嘶嘶聲，地面上爬滿了蜿蜒的蛇群。在黑暗之中，我們聽到一種無法理解的語言在此起彼伏地吼叫著。沒時間收拾營地了；我們得抓緊時間逃跑。安德里亞的喉嚨被一根黑羽箭刺中，她驚恐的尖叫永遠被扼在喉嚨裡，叫不出聲。在我們一路向北，逃到河谷時，何塞被一條巨蟒緊緊纏住。我們還沒來得及施以援手，他的脖子就被折斷了。\n"
"我們終於到達了叢林北部邊境，瑪利亞和卡車就在這等著我們。我們到了墨西哥城之後，才停下了腳步。至今我仍沒有安全感：在親眼目睹那一切之後，我們還能重獲安全感嗎？\n"
"讓埃茲特里和這個被遺忘的地方都見鬼去吧。"
