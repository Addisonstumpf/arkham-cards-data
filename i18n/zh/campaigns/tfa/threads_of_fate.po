msgid "The night passes with Ichtaca resting in your living room. You get no sleep for the remainder of the night, your thoughts drifting between concern and disbelief. Her story is preposterous, but you feel compelled to believe it nonetheless. You’ve known that the relic from the Eztli ruins had some deeper purpose ever since you first laid eyes on it. When you emerge from your bedroom the next morning, your uninvited guest is sitting at your dining-room table, arms crossed tightly across her chest. Her piercing eyes trace your every move like a bird watching its prey. No pleasantries are exchanged. “Where is the relic now?” Ichtaca asks impatiently. “Where have you brought it?” You explain that it is safe, in good hands. She shakes her head, her knuckles white with frustration. “I assure you it is not.”"
msgstr "伊塔卡在你的客廳裡休息過夜。你整晚都睡不著，思緒在擔憂和懷疑之間游移不定。她所說的匪夷所思，但儘管如此，你認為自己必須相信她說的話。自從你見到埃茲特里遺物的第一眼開始，你就知道它有著某種更深層的意義。第二天早上，當你從自己的臥室走出來時，那位不速之客就坐在你的餐桌旁邊，雙手緊緊地在胸前交叉。你每走一步，她銳利的目光都緊緊跟隨。就像鳥兒在監視著自己的獵物。你二人不互致寒暄，直奔主題。“那件遺物現在在哪？”伊塔卡焦躁地問道，“你把它帶到哪裡去了？”你解釋說遺物現在很安全，由正派的人士保管。她失望地搖了搖頭，手指的關節攥得發白：“我很確定地告訴你，它現在一點也不安全。”"

"Setting aside your many questions for the time being, you call your contact at the Miskatonic University Museum. Despite the early hour, Dr. Horowitz should be at her office preparing for the long day ahead of her. The operator connects you after a short delay. Elli gives you an unusually curt greeting, her voice cracking and unsteady. As soon as you ask about the relic, she scoffs. “Not you, too! Mr. Walsted is practically knocking down my office door, and two reporters have been harrassing me all morning!”\n"
"You ask her what the trouble is, and she lets out a long sigh. “The relic is missing,” she explains. “None of the security guards knows what happened. One minute it was in its display case; the next it was gone. And before you ask, no, Mr. Vela is nowhere to be found.” Suddenly she is yelling to another party, “One moment please! I am on the telephone!” She apologizes to you tersely and hangs up a moment later.\n"
"Sure enough, Alejandro is not answering his telephone, and none of his other associates have seen him since yesterday. “Believe me now?” Ichtaca asks, rising to her feet and gathering her things. “We’ve wasted enough time. Find the relic and meet me back here tonight. Don’t follow me.”"

"你問她遇到了什麼麻煩事，而她長嘆了一口氣。“遺物不見了，”她解釋道，“保安沒有一個人知道它是怎麼丟的。上一分鐘它還待在展覽櫃裡；而下一分鐘它就不見了。你是不是想問維拉在哪，他不見了，哪都找不到他的蹤影。”她突然對別人叫道，“請再等一會兒！我正在打電話！”她簡短地對你表示歉意，下一刻便掛了電話。\n"
"果然，亞歷山卓沒有接電話，而從昨天開始，其他同事就沒人見過他了。“現在你相信我了嗎？”伊塔卡站起來收拾她的東西，向你發問，“我們不能再這麼浪費時間。去找遺物，然後今晚回到這兒跟我碰面，不要跟著我。”"

"Setting aside your many questions for the time being, you call Harlan’s office at the university. Though the sun is barely peeking over the horizon, you’ve always known him to be an early riser. The operator connects you after a short delay. Harlan’s voice is shaky and rough.\n"
"He cuts you off as soon as you ask about the relic. “Don’t!” he barks. “They’re listening. They know I am keeping it here. They have already taken Alejandro.” You try to calm him down so you can ask him what he means, but he cuts the conversation short. “I have to go. They are here!—” The line goes dead.\n"
"Sure enough, Alejandro is not answering his telephone, and none of his other associates have seen him since yesterday. “Believe me now?” Ichtaca asks, rising to her feet and gathering her things. “We’ve wasted enough time. Find the relic and meet me back here tonight. <i>Don’t</i> follow me.”"

"你將心中的困惑暫且擱置，給哈倫在大學裡的辦公室打了個電話。雖然這時太陽還沒從地平線上升起，但你知道他是個早起的人。過了一會，接線員接通了你的電話。哈倫的聲音發顫而粗啞。當你問起那件遺物的時候，他打斷了你的問話。“別！”他吼道，“有人在偷聽。他們知道我把它藏在這兒。亞歷山卓已經被他們抓走了。”你試著讓他平靜下來，好問清楚他說的是甚麼意思，但他馬上中斷了談話。“我得走了，他們來了！——”電話斷線了。\n"

"Ichtaca grits her teeth and pauses. You expect her to refuse and leave without answering your questions, but surprisingly, she relents. According to Ichtaca, her people have spent ages protecting the relic from interlopers who would use it for nefarious purposes. She speaks cryptically, in half-riddles and tall tales, although she refuses to explain where her people come from and how they have remained hidden for so long. When pressed about the relic, all she says is that it controls the flow of time, and that it must not be tampered with.\n"
"“It must return to its rightful place,” she explains. Her gaze is relentless, unwavering. “Do you understand? It cannot fall into the wrong hands. If you help me recover it, I will aid you in return. Just promise me you will not use it.”"

"伊塔卡牙關緊咬，停下了動作。你本以為她會拒絕你，直接離開並且不回答你的問題，但令你驚訝的是，她的態度變得緩和。伊塔卡說，她的同胞經歷了多個時代，保護遺物不落入心懷鬼胎的入侵者手中。她的話神秘兮兮，參雜著謎一般的語言和荒誕不經的故事，不過她拒絕解釋她的同胞是從哪裡來的、他們又是怎麼存活至今而不被發現的。當問到遺物時，她只說它能控制時間流，而且它絕對不能被篡改。\n"
"“必須將它放回正確的地方。”她說道，視線冷酷無比，堅定不移，“你明白嗎？它不能落入壞人手裡。如果你幫我找回它，作為回報，我也會幫助你。只要你答應我，你不會利用它。”"
