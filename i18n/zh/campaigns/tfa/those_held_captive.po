msgid "You turn your attention to your surroundings. Though the creatures that ambushed you are nowhere to be found, Alejandro lies on the ground nearby, stirring into consciousness. To your surprise, he appears just as confused as you are. At first, it seems as though he recalls nothing of the previous expedition or the Eztli relic, but then his eyes suddenly spark with recognition. He grips your shoulder tightly and gazes at you as though for the first time in years. “I do remember! We shared one mind for some time, the creature and I. It wished to find the Eztli relic, though for what purpose, I do not know.” He slumps backward against the stone wall, recovering from the sudden influx of memories. “You believed me at every turn, even when the creature had control. You saved me from that abysmal place and brought me back to humanity. For this, I cannot begin to repay you.” He shakes your hand vigorously, filled with a sudden and intense resolve. “We will right all of this, you and I. Then, we will tell the world what we have seen.”"
msgstr "你注意周遭的環境。儘管伏擊你的生物已不知所蹤，亞歷山卓就躺在附近的地面上，他搖晃著自己的腦袋以恢復意識。令你驚訝的是，他跟你一樣感到困惑。他一開始似乎完全想不起上一次探險和埃兹特里遺物，但隨後他雙眼靈光一閃，想了起來。他緊緊抓著你的肩膀，目不轉晴地盯著你，仿佛是多年後的初次對視。“我記起來了！我和那頭生物曾在一段時間裡共享意識。它想找到那個埃兹特里遺物，但它出於什麼目的，我就不知道了。”記憶突然湧入腦海，他向後退去，貼著石壁癱坐在地面，“你每次都信任我，即使是那頭生物控制著我的時候也是。你把我從那個深不見底的地方救了出來，還將我帶回人世。此等恩情，我無以為報。”他激動地握著你的手，心中突然決心篤定，“我們將會把這一切撥亂反正，就我和你。然後，我們再把自己的所見公諸於世。”"

msgid "The narrow steps on the other side of the stone doorway seem almost endless. Though a dim red glow emanates from deeper within the cavern, no matter how many steps you traverse, the glow does not brighten. It almost seems to grow more distant with each step, mocking your tenacity. After a short while, you come to a small ledge where a stone gate bars your passage deeper into the cavern. The gate bears a familiar carved pattern, faded from age and disrepair, and seeping with an oddly discolored purulence."
msgstr "在石門的另一邊有著狹窄的階梯，幾乎看不到盡頭。儘管洞穴深處發出一抹昏暗的紅色光芒，但是不管你走了多少步，光芒也沒有變得明亮一些。似乎每走一步，距離就變得更加遙遠，仿佛在嘲笑著你的執著。過了一陣，你來到一處窄小的平台，面前有一扇石門阻擋著你繼續深入洞穴。這扇門有著熟悉的雕刻紋樣，被歲月磨蝕，幾不可見，還流著怪異的變色膿漿。"

msgid "Check your supplies to see if any investigator has chalk."
msgstr "查看你們的補給品，檢查是否有調查員帶有粉筆。"

msgid "The Way is Open"

msgid "The situation sparks your memory, and you consult the expedition journal. The pattern is similar to one found in the Eztli ruins. Using your chalk and the drawings in your journal as a reference, you restore the glyph in its entirety, and the grooves glow brightly once more. The stone gate lifts on its own, and you are able to continue onward."
msgstr "當下的情況勾起了你的回憶，於是你翻閱探險日誌。這個紋樣與在埃茲特里遺跡找到的一個紋樣相近。用上粉筆，再加日誌上的圖畫作參考，你重新排列出完整的字符，隨後凹槽再次發出了明亮的光芒。石門自動開啟，你可以繼續前進了。"

msgid "You are unsure how to proceed. After debating the merits of each of your options, you decide that brute force may be the only solution. It takes all of your strength to lift the stone, and you open the way forward for each of you one at a time. It is no simple task, and your body aches tremendously from the effort."
msgstr "你不知道如何前進。在權衡各個方案的優點之後，你認為使用蠻力可能是唯一的解決辦法。你用盡全力來推動這塊石頭，開啟了前進的道路，每個人依次通過。這不是一件易事，你的身體在勞累過後疼痛不已。"

msgid "When drawing opening hands during the next scenario, investigators cannot take a mulligan."
msgstr "下一場冒險期間，在抽取起始手牌時，調查員不能進行換牌。"

msgid "Hours later, you are almost too weary to go on. Every inch of your body aches with intense pain. There is nothing in this desolate cavern to eat but the occasional wild mushroom, and although temptation gnaws at your insides, you cannot tell which are toxic and which are healthy…"
msgstr "幾個小時之後，你疲倦不堪，無法繼續前進。你身體的每一寸都劇痛不已。這個荒涼的洞穴裡沒有食物，只有不時發現的一些野生蘑菇，仿佛引誘著你將它吃下，但你不知道哪些蘑菇有毒，而哪些無毒……"

msgid "The poison has spread to nearly every part of your body. Your skin pales, and you are covered in cold feverish sweat. Simply rising to your feet requires a tremendous effort, and you get no rest at night despite your exhaustion. It won’t be long now before the poison claims your life."
msgstr "毒性幾乎傳遍了你身體的每一部位。你的皮膚變得蒼白，發熱產生的冷汗浸濕你全身。只是站起身就要耗費巨大的力氣，而即使你筋疲力盡，你仍然無法在夜間入睡。過不了多久，毒性就會要了你的命。"

msgid "After descending hundreds and hundreds of steps, you decide to stop and rest. Though your watch tells you that night has fallen, the lack of natural sky is starting to affect your internal clock. With no flat ledge in sight, each member of your party claims one of the many narrow steps to sleep on."
msgstr "在向下走了數百級台階之後，你決定停下來休息。儘管你的手錶顯示此時已是夜晚，但見不到本來的天空，使得你生物鐘開始受到影響。周圍看不到任何平地，你隊伍中的每個成員各自佔據了幾格狹窄的台階，用來睡覺。"

msgid "Sleep does not come easily for you. Barely any layers protect you from the bitter cold of the underground cavern, and you lie shivering for hours before exhaustion finally claims you. You awaken every hour or so as the shifting of your body almost causes you to tumble off your stone perch. When “morning” comes, you are even more weary than you were the previous night."
msgstr "你沒法輕鬆入睡。幾乎沒有任何遮蓋物能夠讓你免受這地下洞穴的嚴寒，你躺著瑟瑟發抖，直到精疲力竭。你每個小時都會醒來，而每次醒來時你的身體只要稍作移動，都會讓你滾下石階。在“早晨”到來時，你比前一晚還更加疲倦。"

msgid "Though you long for a proper bed, at least your blanket protects you from the frigid chill that permeates the cavern. When “morning” arrives, your body longs for more sleep, but you know you must press onward and reach the Nexus as fast as you can…"
msgstr "儘管你渴望一張合適的床，但至少你的毛毯使你不受洞穴內彌漫的寒意所侵襲。在“早晨”到來時，你的身體渴望著繼續休息，但你知道你必須繼續前進，盡快到達聯結點。"
