"Crimson-tinted fog bathes the sky as you reach the gatehouse of Falcon Point. Atop the cliffs above you, the lighthouse beacon pierces through the mist. Considering the state of Innsmouth, you wonder what purpose the signal serves now. You doubt there are any ships out at sea given the inclement weather.\n"
"Somewhere inside is the evidence you found weeks ago. You suspect that Oceiros—the man who captured you and left you in that pit to die—also resides within. \"Are you ready?\" Agent Harper asks. \"We have no real escape route here, should things go south. Be prepared for anything.\"\n"
"You nod. It's too late to turn back now. Steadily, you make your way toward the cliffs. One way or another, this ends today."

"你到達獵鷹岬門房的時候，天上瀰漫著深紅色的濃霧。唯有頭頂懸崖上的燈塔發出的亮光刺透迷霧。你想到印斯茅斯如今的情況，不禁好奇這樣的訊號是為誰發出。這般惡劣的天氣，你懷疑壓根兒就不會有船出海。\n"
"這裡面某個地方有你數週前追尋的證據。你懷疑奧賽羅思——那個抓住你，把你留在深坑中等死的男人——也住在這裡。“你準備好了嗎？”哈珀特工問道，“要是事情失控，這裡可沒有逃生之路。要做好應對一切可能的準備。”\n"

"You peer up at Falcon Point lighthouse, but from much further below. You are aboard Mr. Moore's fishing vessel, during your voyage to Devil Reef several weeks earlier. The ship sways back and forth as angry waves thrash against its hull. \"'Fraid it's gon' be a bit rocky,\" the ship captain shouts over the crashing of the tumultuous sea. \"Weather's been awful wild of late. Strange tides an' stranger winds.\"\n"
"But still you stare up at the ominous lighthouse, its beacon a guiding light, a warning sign, or both. Curious what knowledge he might have, you ask Mr. Moore about the lighthouse. \"That ol' thing? Been there longer'n Innsmouth itself. Marsh family's kept it runnin' as long as I remember. Oceiros is keeper now. Strange fella, that Oceiros. They say the only place in town he visits is the Order o' Dagon hall by New Church Green.\" He shakes his head.\n"
"You wonder if there are more secrets inside the lighthouse than meets the eye. Mr. Moore seems to note your curiosity. \"I've heard them Marshes've carved out caverns beneath the lighthouse goin' all the way down to sea level an' beyond,\" he claims. \"Dunno if that's true, but sometimes when I'm out at sea I've seen groups of 'em up by the cliffside, all wavin' an kneelin' like they're prayin' or something. Never really paid it much mind, but…\" his voice grows quieter. \"Jus' thought you oughta know.\"\n"
"You nod and thank him. If what he's saying is true, perhaps you should give this lighthouse a visit. You make a mental note to research more about Falcon Point once you return to town.\n"
"When your mind snaps back to the present, you recall the legwork you'd done after your expedition to Devil Reef, and the information you found on the vast network of tunnels beneath the lighthouse…"

"你向上凝視著獵鷹岬的燈塔，但視線所處位置遠低於懸崖。此刻恰是幾週前，你在摩爾船長的船上，正在前往魔鬼礁石的路上。怒濤猛擊船身，船隻前後搖擺。“怕不只是有點兒晃了。”船長的叫聲蓋過了喧鬧的海浪撞擊的聲音，“近來這天氣真是見了鬼。怪風怪浪的。”\n"
"但你依然抬頭望著如讖的燈塔，它發出的是指引，是警告，抑或都是？你好奇摩爾船長會不會知道什麼，於是問他燈塔的事。“那東西？比印斯茅斯都老。咱記得以來，那兒就是馬什家在管。現在的看門人是奧賽羅思。怪傢伙，那個奧賽羅思。大夥說他在村子裡就只去新格林教會的達貢密教大廳。”他搖了搖頭。\n"
"你想知道燈塔裡是否有比目見所及更多的秘密。摩爾船長似乎注意到了你的好奇。“咱聽說燈塔下面馬什一家挖出洞來了，一直通到海平面以下去。”他說道，“不知道真假，但咱有時候出海，能看見他們一群人在懸崖邊上，揮著手，跪著，像在祈禱還是幹啥。我倒是沒咋注意過，但……”他的聲音矮了下去，“就是覺得你該知道。”\n"
"你點頭道謝。要是他所言非虛，或許你應該造訪燈塔一回。你心中暗暗記下，等回到鎮子之後，要再多探查獵鷹岬一番。\n"

He's found his own little corner of the pub in which to hide and drown himself in alcohol. So much the better—you'd prefer to keep your investigation quiet.\n"
"You jot down notes as the drunken man rambles on about the creatures he's seen swimming off the coast and prowling around the reefs. \"Deep Ones,\" he names them. \"Caught one in my net once,\" he blabbers through slurred speach. \"She an' her eggs—tha's right!—'er eggs, bigger'n your fist, an' squirmin' an' wrigglin', too!\"\n"
"Absorbed in the ritual of telling a tale for his fellow sailors, he elaborates: \"She had one of 'em in her arms. Tiny little devil, with bulgin', hateful eyes. Couldn't stand the sight of it. I threw the net o'er as soon as I realized what I'd caught, an' came right back 'ere. If I had my way I'd never sail 'gain.\"\n"
