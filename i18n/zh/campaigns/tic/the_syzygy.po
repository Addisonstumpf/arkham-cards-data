"Light flashes in your mind. Shadows drown your thoughts as the memory fades. You are lying once again on the rocky beach off the coast, your skull pounding in agony. Agent Harper leans over you with worry etched in her brow. \"Hey! Hey, you finally awake?\"\n"
"You sit up, your muscles aching. It looks like the tide rose several more inches while you were out. The cold water laps at your ankles and soaks into your shoes. \"What happened?\" she says. \"What did you see?\""
msgstr ""
"你腦海中閃過亮光。記憶褪去，又是一陣陰影籠罩。你又躺在了海岸邊的岩石上，腦子裡一片劇痛。哈珀特工俯身瞧著你，眉眼間全是擔憂。“嘿！嘿，你終於醒了？”\n"
"你坐了起來，肌肉酸痛。看上去海水比你昏過去的時候又漲了幾寸。冰水漫過你的腳踝，滲進你的鞋子。“發生了什麼？”她說道，“你看到了什麼？”"

"You tell Harper you remember your mission to find her, but that after a week of searching, you hadn't been able to do so. The last thing you remember was somebody slipping a notebook under your hotel room door with some information regarding an organization called the \"Esoteric Order of Dagon.\"\n"
"\"Oh. Yeah, that was me. Sorry I couldn't stick around and chat, but I had some other business to attend to,\" she explains. She tells you that after several days in captivity, she finally managed to get the upper hand against her captor and free herself, but she was injured in the process. As if to prove her story, she opens her trenchcoat, and you see dark bloodstains seeping through her button-up shirt. Several bandages peek out beneath the fabric. \"Just barely missed my kidney. Lucky me, eh?\"\n"
"You complain that you were wasting your time searching high and low for her, and she scoffs. \"Hardly! You learned more in one week than I did in two. I knew that you were onto something, and I wanted to help out, but I was still being followed. So I dropped off the one solid bit of research I'd found and laid low for a while. It was you who did the rest really.\" Sadly, you remember nothing of \"the rest.\""

"你告訴哈珀你記起了自己的任務是找到她。但搜尋一週之後，你一無所獲。你能記得的最後一件事，就是有人把一本筆記扔進了你的房間，上面寫著和“達貢密教”有關的消息。\n"
"“哦。對了，那是我。很抱歉我沒能留下來和你詳細談談，但我還有些別的事要做。”她解釋道。她告訴你，在被俘幾天之後，她終於佔了綁匪的上風，自己逃了出來，但她在這過程中受了傷。她敞開自己的戰壕大衣，彷彿是要證明自己的故事。你看見她扣好的襯衫上有暗色的血跡。織物下面印出幾條繃帶。“剛好從腎邊擦過。我還挺幸運的，嗯？”\n"
"你抱怨說自己到處找她真是浪費時間，但她對此嗤之以鼻：“才不是呢！你這一週裡打聽到的事情比我兩週裡的都多。我知道你對事情有眉目了，也想來幫你，但我自己也被人跟著。我不得不暫時放下調查，蟄伏起來。其實剩下的活都是你幹的。”不幸的是，你一點也不記得“剩下的活”是什麼。"

"You tell Harper you remember your mission to find her and the interrogation of her kidnapper. She grins. \"Thanks again for that, by the way. I really did have things under control, though,\" she jokes. \"Do you remember anything after that?\"\n"
"You shake your head. The last thing you remember was the mention of an organization called the \"Esoteric Order of Dagon.\"\n"
"Harper mutters a curse under her breath. \"That's unfortunate. But amnesia or not, at least I know I can trust you. Whether you remember it or not, you've come through for me in the past.\""

"你告訴哈珀你記起了自己的任務是找到她，以及盤問綁匪的事情。她笑了：“順便我還得再次為這謝謝你。儘管我其實已經自己搞定了。”她打趣道，“你還記得那之後的事情嗎？”\n"
"你搖搖頭。你能記得的最後一件事，就是有人提到一個叫“達貢密教”的組織。\n"
"哈珀喘息之間低聲咒罵了一句。“真倒霉。但就算你忘了很多事情，至少我知道我還是能信任你的。無論你是否記得，過去你都成功找到了我。”"

msgid "Any one investigator may add the Elina Harper story asset to their deck. This card does not count against the investigators deck size."
msgstr "任意一位調查員可以選擇將艾蓮娜·哈珀劇情支援加入其牌組。這張卡牌不計入該調查員牌組的卡牌張數。"

msgid "\"Don't worry,\" she says, \"I'll catch you up. There's a lot you still don't remember.\" Just then, a resounding crash of thunder echoes on the eastern horizon, and a powerful wave smashes against the jetties. The sky is a deep crimson red behind blackening storm clouds that swirl around the sun and the moon. The celestial bodies hang together in perfect alignment. \"That can't be good.\" Harper's lips turn rigid with concern. \"Okay, new plan. Let's get back to Innsmouth. I'll explain what I know along the way.\""
msgstr "“別擔心。”她說道，“我會都告訴你的。還有很多事情你不記得。”就在這時，東邊的地平線上炸響一聲雷鳴，巨浪沖刷著堤壩。天空一片深紅，日月完美排成一線，四周黑雲翻滾。“這可不妙了。”哈珀擔憂地咬緊雙脣，“好吧，計劃有變。讓我們回印斯茅斯去。我路上跟你解釋。”"
