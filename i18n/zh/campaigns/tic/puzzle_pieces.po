"You have no idea who this woman is or how she knows you, yet she seems comfortable and familiar with you. You strain your memory trying to think of how you might have met, but it's no use. You're certain she is a complete stranger. Having woken up in a cold, wet prison with no memories, you aren't feeling very sociable. Your fear and distrust must show, because the woman backs off and narrows her eyes. \"What is it? What's wrong?\"\n"
"You respond by asking the woman if you know her. \"You truly don't remember? Well, that's going to complicate things. What do you recall? Do you remember anything?\"\n"
"You relate to the woman the flashes of recollection that you experienced earlier…"

"儘管這女人看起來十分放鬆，和你很是熟悉，但你還是一點兒也不認識她，更不知道她是怎麼認識你的。你絞盡腦汁，想要回憶你在哪見過她，但毫無頭緒。你確定她完全是個陌生人。說實話，你剛從冰冷潮溼的牢籠中醒來，腦子裡一片空白，並不是很想說話。你臉上一定露出了驚嚇和懷疑的表情，因為這女子退了一步，皺起了眉頭。“咋了？出啥事了？”\n"
"你轉而問她，自己是不是認識她。“你真的啥也不記得了？好吧，這下可麻煩了。你還能記起啥？有啥事是你還能想起來的不？”\n"
"你把自己先前體驗的閃回記憶告訴了這個女人……"

msgid ""
"You put two and two together and ask if the woman is Miss Harper. \"Ah, so you do remember me?\" she asks with a playful smirk, but you shake your head in response and explain that you only remember being hired by a man named Thomas Dawson to find her. \"But that was… oh. You have forgotten a lot, haven't you? Speaking of Dawson, where is he? Did you see him down there?\"\n"
"Your thoughts turn to the twisted, mangled face that triggered your flashback. Agent Harper's expression turns dour as she watches your eyes. \"…I see. I wish he hadn't come to this forsaken town. Those brutes are going to pay for this.\" You ask who she thinks is responsible for Dawson's death, and she raises her eyebrows in response. \"Right, you don't remember. As far as I know, the last time anybody saw either of you was just before you visited the Esoteric Order of Dagon. Draw your own conclusions.\""

"你回溯記憶，進行猜測，詢問女子她是否就是哈珀女士。“啊，所以你還是記得我的？”她戲謔地笑著問道。但你搖了搖頭，解釋說自己只記得有個叫托馬斯·道森的人僱你來找她。“但這……哦。你忘掉的東西可真不少？說到道森，他在哪兒？你在下面見著他了？”\n"
"你想到了那張扭曲損毀的臉，正是它喚醒了你的記憶。看到你的眼神，哈珀特工瞬間失色：“……我明白了。要是他沒來這個被遺棄的村莊就好了。那幫惡人會付出代價的。”你問她覺得誰該為道森之死負責，而她抬了抬眉毛以作回應。“喔對，你都不記得了。據我所知，最後一次有人看到你倆，是在達貢密教門前。你自己想吧。”"

msgid "You shake your head. You remember nothing. \"That's going to make this difficult,\" the woman says with a sigh. \"All right. Well, I'll tell you what I know. I am Agent Elina Harper. My understanding is that you were hired by my boss, Agent Thomas Dawson, thanks to your deeper understanding of… well, of things that don't really make sense to the rest of us.\" You ask what task you were hired to perform, and the woman smirks. \"You were hired to find me, actually. The Order wasn't too happy about that. It's a bit of a long story. Let's get out of here first, and then I can catch you up on all of that.\""
msgstr "你搖搖頭。你什麼也不記得。“這下事情可麻煩了。”這女人嘆了口氣，“好吧。我來說說我知道的。我是艾蓮娜·哈珀特工。在我看來，僱你的是我的老闆，托馬斯·道森特工，因為你深刻地瞭解……好吧，瞭解對咱而言沒啥道理的事情。”你問她是否知道自己被僱來幹什麼的，但這女人笑了。“其實你是被僱來找我的。但密教對此可不樂意。說來話長。讓我們先離開這兒，我再一五一十地都告訴你。”"

Let's hope we don't have to head back that way anytime soon… and let's hope that <i>thing</i> stays dead.\""
msgstr "你把自己和某種水生生物的大戰告訴了哈珀特工。“魔鬼礁石。”她打了個寒顫，“無論村子裡發生了啥事，源頭都能找到魔鬼礁石那兒去。但願咱不用再走回頭路過去……但願那東西真的死了。"

msgid "\"So you and Dawson were looking for me together, then? Interesting.\" She considers this for a moment. \"I guess even the extraordinary Captain Dawson can be rattled from time to time. It's somewhat gratifying to know he cared that much about finding me. Still…\" her gaze wanders towards the horizon. \"All right, Dawson. I'll make sure you didn't die in vain. I'll burn this whole town to the ground if I have to.\""
msgstr "“所以你是和道森一起找我，嗯？有意思。”她想了一會兒，“我猜就算是傑出的道森上尉，有時候也會手忙腳亂。知道他把找我放在心上，還是挺痛快的。只是……”她遠眺地平線，“好的，道森。我發誓不會讓你白死。就算要把這村子燒成灰，我也一定辦到。”"

msgid "If <i>an encounter with a secret cult</i> is listed under \"Memories Recovered\":"

msgid "You describe your memory from inside some kind of cult headquarters. \"Sounds like that must have taken place inside the Esoteric Order of Dagon building on the north side of town,\" Agent Harper reasons. \"That organization is vile: I just know it. I have no evidence to bring back, though, and it sounds like you've forgotten everything you learned.\" She curses under her breath."
msgstr "你把自己在邪教總部的遭遇描述了一番。“聽起來定是在村子北邊的達貢密教。”哈珀特工推理道，“那組織邪惡得很：這我能肯定。但我沒能把證據帶回來。聽上去你也把自己知道的事情全忘了。”她喘息之間全是咒罵。"

"You point to the strange, crimson horizon behind Agent Harper and note aloud the alignment of the sun and the moon. \"That began just after you and Agent Dawson entered the Order's headquarters,\" she explains. \"That was almost three days ago. I have no idea what it means, but I can't imagine it is anything good. All of Innsmouth's been locked tight lately. Not a soul in sight. You're lucky I figured out where to look for you.\"\n"
"Your mind reels. The last thing you remember before waking up in that dank pit was enjoying a pleasant late-summer's eve in Arkham. Now you're in another town altogether, and your memory is filled with gaping holes. You wonder aloud what the date is, and Agent Harper replies: \"It's the twenty-fourth of September. I don't know when exactly you arrived in Innsmouth or how much of your memory is missing. Isn't there anything else you remember? Anything at all?\"\n"
"The water sloshes against your feet as you struggle to remember. In minutes, the tide has risen several inches, and there's no sign of it slowing down. You fix your gaze on the woman who stands before you—her weary eyes, her disheveled clothes, the red marks on her wrists—and something triggers in your recollection.\n"
"\"Wake up. We're almost there.\" The memory lurks at the precipice of your consciousness, threatening to draw you into the darkness. \"Hey. Wake up, I said.\" You clutch your forehead as searing pain bounces throughout your skull. \"Wake up, dammit!\"\n"
"Darkness pulls at the edges of your vision. More memories come flooding back…"

"你指向哈珀特工身後詭異的深紅色天際線，提醒她日月如今已成一線。“你和道森特工一進密教總部，就變成了這樣。”她解釋道，“大概有三天了。我不知道這意味著啥，但怎麼想都不會是好事。最近整個印斯茅斯都封鎖了。一個人也見不著。我可算找到了該去哪兒找你，這你可真走運。”\n"
"你驚愕不已。在身處潮溼的深坑之前，你能想起來的最後一件事，還是在阿卡姆愉快的暮夏一夜。現在你卻完全在另一個村子，記憶千瘡百孔。你問今天是什麼日子，哈珀特工回道：“九月二十四號。我不知道你究竟是啥時候到印斯茅斯的，也不知道你的記憶究竟缺了多少。還有啥是你能想起來的嗎？任何事情？”\n"
"就在你盡力回想的時候，海水沖刷著你的腳底。潮水幾分鐘內就上漲了幾寸，並且全無減緩的跡象。你凝視著眼前站著的這個女人——她疲憊的雙眼、凌亂的衣服、手腕上的紅印子——觸發了你的某段回憶。\n"
"“醒醒。我們就要到了。”回憶潛伏在你意識的邊緣，要將你拖入黑暗。“嘿。醒醒，我說。”你緊按額頭，腦子裡一陣灼痛。“醒醒！他媽的！”\n"
"你眼前一片漆黑。更多的回憶湧了回來……"
