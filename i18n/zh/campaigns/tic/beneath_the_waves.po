"You bounce through your memories, struggling to return to the present. You remember a dark cell. A knife at your throat. A man with wide, unblinking eyes, wearing a long hooded robe. \"Oceiros,\" another voice calls, \"these ones were found in Dagon's lair as well. We believe they were the ones snooping around Devil Reef.\"\n"
"Oceiros nods. The knife at your throat digs deeper. \"Take what they have stolen to the lighthouse at once,\" he commands. \"It is time to begin our great work. None will disrupt the Order's business ever again.\"\n"
"Your mind snaps back to the present. The rumbling of an automobile engine grows as your senses return. Agent Harper grips your shoulder and peers into your eyes. \"Another vision,\" she utters with a hint of surprise. \"Do you remember something? What was it?\"\n"
"You shake the ache from your pounding skull and ask Harper if the name Oceiros means anything. \"Oceiros Marsh? He's the keeper of the old lighthouse on Falcon Point,\" she replies. \"Why? What did you see?\""

"你的意識在回憶中四處遊蕩，掙扎著想要回到現實。你記起了黑色的牢房。抵在你脖頸的尖刀。一個巨眼腫脹的男子，袍子上有長長的兜帽。“奧賽羅思。”另一個聲音叫道，“這傢伙也是在達貢巢穴裡拉到的。我們覺得在魔鬼礁石刺探的就是這幫傢伙了。”\n"
"奧賽羅思點了點頭。抵在你喉嚨的刀刺得更深了。“馬上把他們偷的東西帶到燈塔去。”他命令道，“是時候開始我們的大業了。沒有人能阻止密教了。”\n"
"你的思緒回到了現實。你重獲知覺，汽車的引擎聲也越來越大。哈珀特工抓著你的肩膀，盯著你的眼睛。“又是幻象。”她的語氣裡帶一絲驚訝，“你記起什麼了嗎？是什麼？”\n"
"你搖搖頭，把痛感從砰砰作響的腦子裡趕走。你問哈珀特工，“奧賽羅思”是否意味著什麼。“奧賽羅思·馬什？他是獵鷹岬上老燈塔的看門人。”她回道，“怎麼？你看到什麼了？”"

msgid "You describe the idol found in the undersea grotto. Agent Harper nods along with you. \"I remember seeing something like that in some of the notes I found while you were off investigating the reef. It depicts some kind of ancient deity—something those vile creatures worship.\" Her voice lowers to little more than a whisper. \"Something I suspect is no myth.\" You ask where the idol is now, and she shakes her head. \"I suspect it was taken from you when you were thrown into that pit,\" she replies."
msgstr "你描述自己在海下岩洞發現的偶像。哈珀特工點頭應和。“我記得你在調查礁石的時候，我在找到的筆記裡見過與之類似的東西。它描繪的是某種古代神靈——正是那些邪惡生物崇拜的東西。”她的聲音低了下去，只比耳語略高，“那東西我懷疑並不是神話。”你問她偶像現在在哪兒，她卻只是搖了搖頭。“我懷疑是你被扔到坑裡的時候，被人拿走了。”她回道。"

msgid "You recall the strange mantle you found submerged in the depths of Devil Reef. \"Yes, I remember seeing that,\" Harper says with a snap of her fingers. \"One of the 'priests' in that accursed Esoteric Order of Dagon wore it when I first arrived in Innsmouth. It must have been taken to the lighthouse with the rest of your belongings when you were captured at the Order's headquarters. If we're lucky, it'll still be there…\""
msgstr "你回憶自己在魔鬼礁石水下深處發現的奇怪斗篷。“哦，我記得見過那個。”哈珀打了個響指說道，“我第一次到印斯茅斯的時候，那個該死的‘達貢密教’裡有個‘祭司’就穿著這個。你在密教總部被抓住的時候，斗篷肯定和你的其他東西一起被帶到燈塔去了。要是我們幸運的話，它還會在那兒……”"

msgid "You tell Agent Harper about the temple with the two statues you discovered within Devil Reef, and about the crown you stole. \"That sounds like the 'Headdress of Y'ha-nthlei' I read about while I was researching the Order. I'm impressed you were able to make off with it. Whatever it is, it sounds pretty important to the Order. Although I still have no clue what 'Y'ha-nthlei' is.\" You remark that you don't have the crown anymore, and she nods. \"It must have been taken from you and brought to the lighthouse with the rest of your things before you lost your memories,\" she explains."
msgstr "你告訴了哈珀特工你在魔鬼礁石發現的神廟，裡面的兩尊雕像，還有你偷走的頭冠。“聽起來像是‘伊哈·恩斯雷的頭冠’，我以前在研究密教時讀到過。你能帶著它溜出來，我真是佩服。無論這到底是什麼東西，肯定都對密教很重要。儘管我並沒找到線索證明‘伊哈·恩斯雷’究竟是什麼。”你說頭冠現在並不在你手上，她點了點頭。“肯定是在你失憶之前，頭冠就和你的其他東西一起被帶到燈塔去了。”她解釋道。"

msgid "You struggle to remember anything of value beyond your initial exploration of the reef. You recall the uncanny creatures you fought, the various islands you explored, and the rising tides, but no more. Secrets must be hidden in those reefs, but either you were unable to find them, or you simply don't recall. Your head throbs with pain as you struggle to summon memories from the void within your mind. \"That's okay,\" Agent Harper says, placing a hand on your shoulder. \"We'll figure this out together.\""
msgstr "你極力回憶自己一開始探索礁石到底有沒有發現什麼有價值的東西。你回憶起自己戰鬥過的可怕怪物、探索過的無數島礁，還有不斷上漲的潮水。除此之外，再無其他。肯定還有秘密潛藏在礁石之下，但你沒能發現，又或者只是沒能記起。你極力從腦海空白之處呼喚記憶，但回應你的只有一陣刺痛。“不妨事的。”哈珀特工將手放在你的肩上，“我們會一起找出來的。”"

"\"It seems your memories are starting to return,\" Agent Harper says with a tentative grin. \"How do you feel?\"\n"
"You struggle to find a reply that fits. Part of you is relieved to have your memories returning, but the rest of you wishes they hadn't been so vivid. You wonder once more if you should simply take this opportunity to drive back to Arkham and never set foot in Innsmouth again. Then your gaze meets Harper's, and you see that fierce resolve within her eyes. The same resolve that stirs in you.\n"
"You say nothing, but she seems to understand. \"This must be a lot to take in. For now, let's focus on getting to Falcon Point. If what you say is true, and Oceiros is part of the Esoteric Order of Dagon, there should be answers there.\" She looks over her shoulder, peering into the western horizon. The sun dips just below the treeline, bathing the sky in deep scarlet. \"Something tells me this isn't over.\""

"“看起來你的記憶開始回來了。”哈珀特工露出一個試探的笑容，“感覺怎麼樣？”\n"
"你絞盡腦汁想找到合適的回答。能取回記憶，你是鬆了口氣。但你也想拜託這些記憶能不能別這麼生動。你又一次在想，自己是不是應該抓住這個機會，開車回阿卡姆去，從此不要再來印斯茅斯。你隨即和哈珀對上了眼神，看到了她眼中堅定的決心。你心中也有著同樣的決心。\n"
"你一語不發，但她看上去已然瞭解。“要弄明白這些肯定不容易。現在，讓我們盯準獵鷹岬。要是你所言非虛，而奧賽羅思·馬什是達貢密教的一員，那兒就該有問題的答案。”她回頭看了一眼西方的地平線。日已西垂，低沉到樹冠之下，把天空映得一片深紅。“我總覺得事情還沒結束。”"
