"\"Wake up, dammit!\" Agent Dawson shakes you awake with his right hand. You are in the passenger seat of a pristine, state-of-the-art motorcar, its polished body glowing with light from the moon as it rolls through the foggy Massachusetts countryside. \"We're almost there,\" Dawson informs you. Unfortunately, Innsmouth lacks a working railroad, which you would have preferred. There is a bus that runs from Boston to Newburyport and another that runs from Newburyport to Innsmouth… but Dawson had insisted on driving you there himself, perhaps to provide you an escape route should things go sour, or to show off his expensive automobile. Probably both.\n"
"As you arrive in Innsmouth, the stale odor of day-old fish and decrepit, musty buildings washes over you. Many of the buildings along the western side of the town seem to be abandoned, though you occasionally spot figures in some of the windows. You imagine Agent Dawson's opulent car must make quite an impression in such a dirty and dingy town. You joke that perhaps he should have driven here in a jalopy, to which he replies with a smirk: \"That's never been my style.\"\n"
"Eventually, you reach a defunct railroad station that was given up years ago. A few train cars sit abandoned on the tracks, and the depot is boarded up and condemned. Dawson suddenly grimaces and points to another vehicle in the open lot. \"That's Agent Harper's breezer. Let's park here and continue on foot. We can move through the town a little easier that way,\" he reasons.\n"
"You check Agent Harper's vehicle before continuing, but it contains no clues as to her whereabouts. From there, you head eastward beside the Manuxet River, passing numerous deserted warehouses, sodden alleyways, and standoffish townsfolk. \"Harper's got to be somewhere in this forsaken town. Residents don't look all too friendly. Wouldn't be surprised if she drew too much attention from a local mob or the like…\" Dawson begins to contemplate aloud. You ask how he knows his agent isn't simply keeping a low profile. \"Ah yes—well, we have a code phrase for that. If she had sent me a letter saying she 'had some errands to run,' that would have signalled that she would be out of touch for a short while. Without that signal, I have to assume the worst.\" To the northeast, several factory buildings loom over the rest of the town's sagging gambrel roofs, cupolas, and widow's walks. None of the locals stop to greet you along your way. Given the repulsive countenance that many of them bear, their aversion to the usual small-town pleasantries is a relief.\n"
"Eventually, you reach the town square just south of Manuxet, though even these crumbling brick buildings that surround the supposed heart of the town inspire little confidence in Agent Harper's safety. An old bus idles nearby, its greasy-looking driver leaning against the door and eyeing you suspiciously. With little else to go on, you decide to split up, knowing that you can cover much more ground that way. \"Canvass the locals and learn more about this town,\" Dawson says. \"Find out who the big shots are in this hellhole. One of them is bound to know where Harper was last seen, or who she was with. I'm going to see if I can find where she was hiding out and look for some sign of her. Meet up with me here at 1900 hours. Understood?\" You nod in agreement and go your separate ways.\n"
"The first person you check with is the bus driver, who probably has a decent understanding of the town. His coarse, greyish skin is the first thing you notice, followed swiftly by unusually deep and shadowed creases in the flesh of his neck, almost as if he were prematurely aged. His bulging eyes are unsettling, and you're suddenly unsure whether you've seen him blink even once as you approach. You start to offer your hand as you introduce yourself, then think better of it, just in case the man has some kind of disease you've never heard of. He introduces himself as Joe Sargent and gives you a useful—if cursory—rundown of some of the nearby buildings."

"“醒醒！他媽的！”道森特工用右手把你搖醒。你坐在一輛一等一的嶄新轎車裡，穿行於馬薩諸塞州煙霧朦朧的鄉間小道。月光灑下來，把鋥光發亮的車子照得熠熠生輝。“我們就要到了。”道森告訴你。其實你更想坐火車來此，但不幸的是，並沒有運營的鐵路通往印斯茅斯。從波士頓到紐伯里波特，再從紐伯里波特到印斯茅斯，這一路上倒是有巴士通行……但道森堅持要自己開車帶你去。興許他是打算留下逃跑路線，以備不時之需，或者只是想顯擺他這輛昂貴的新車。又或者，兩者都是。\n"
"你剛一到印斯茅斯，爛魚和發霉的舊房子發出的腐臭就劈頭蓋臉地襲來。村子西邊有許多房子看著已經廢棄，但你不時還能瞧見窗邊閃過人影。你不禁覺得，在這樣一座骯髒昏暗的小村子裡，道森特工華美的轎車肯定引人注目。你打趣說他該開輛破車來的，但他對你微微一笑：“那可不是我的風格。”\n"
"你們最終來到了一座已經廢棄數年的火車站。鐵軌上橫躺著幾節車廂，原本停車的地方已經用木板圍了起來，標誌著此處並不安全。道森臉色突然一變，指著空地上的另一架車：“這是哈珀特工的敞篷車。我們就在這兒停車，接下來的路步行。要穿越村子，這樣更方便。”他說的有理有據。\n"
"你停下來查看了一番哈珀特工的車，但其中並無她下落的蹤跡。你由此沿著馬奴賽特河向東，穿過無數廢棄的倉庫，潮溼的小巷和冷漠的村民。“哈珀肯定就在這座偏遠小村的某個地方。這裡的居民都不太友好。要是當地的幫派，或者別的什麼人注意到了她，那我可不意外……”道森將自己所思大聲地說了出來。你提出或許他手下的特工只是想低調行事。“啊，對了——這麼說吧，我們對此可是有暗號的。要是她給我寄信寫道‘要處理點事情’，那就標誌著她會失聯一段時間。現在連這個訊息都沒有，我只能假設發生了最壞的情況。”在村子東北邊，圓圓方方的屋頂和天台下面藏著幾間工廠。一路上並無當地人停下來和你們打招呼。考慮到他們之中許多人面目可憎，此地並無鄉間慣常的熱情質樸倒是一件好事。\n"
"最後你來到了馬奴賽特河南邊的村鎮廣場，這裡大概就是村子的中心，但四周磚屋傾頹，讓你擔心哈珀特工的安危。一輛舊巴士懶在路邊，油膩的司機靠著車門，滿腹狐疑地望著你。你們毫無頭緒，決定分頭行動，擴大調查的範圍。“和當地人談談，再打聽點這村子的事情。”道森說道，“找出這破地方到底是誰說了算。肯定有人知道哈珀最後出現在哪兒，又是和誰在一塊兒。我去看看能不能找到她藏在哪兒，或是有沒有她留下的記號。晚上七點和我在這兒碰頭。明白嗎？”你點點頭，與他分道揚鑣。\n"
"你打聽的頭一個人就是那巴士司機，他看起來對村子很熟。你最先注意到的是他粗糙發灰的皮膚，緊接著就是他脖子上深深的褶皺，蒙了陰影，看上去老得詭異。他臌脹的雙眼令人不安，而你也不敢確定，自己走近的時候，他是否眼睛一眨都不眨。你伸手介紹自己，但隨即就收回了手，要是他得了某種你從未耳聞的疾病該怎麼辦？他說自己名叫喬·薩金特，向你簡要地介紹了一番附近幾幢房子——雖然簡略，但倒也挺有用。"

msgid "What follows is a summary of the information conveyed to the investigators about the town of Innsmouth."
msgstr "以下是調查員蒐集到的有關印斯茅斯的信息匯總。"

msgid "In plain view of the town square is a grocery of the First National chain, run by a youngster by the name of Brian Burnham, an outsider from Arkham. The idea that somebody else from Arkham might be here fills you with some degree of hope, and perhaps a little bit of pity for the boy."
msgstr "正對著村鎮廣場的是國立第一雜貨鋪，現在操持店面的是一個來自阿卡姆的小夥子，名叫布里安·伯納姆。這兒居然還有人來自阿卡姆。這樣的念頭讓你有了點希望，同時也有點同情這個男孩。"

msgid "The Gilman House, owned by Othera Gilman, is the only hotel in town. Considering its shabby appearance, you suddenly wish you'd only planned a day trip."
msgstr "歐斯拉·吉爾曼的吉爾曼旅社是村子裡唯一的旅店。看它這破破爛爛的樣子，你真希望自己這趟旅程是一日來回。"

msgid "Down the street from the Gilman House, tucked between a dismal restaurant and a drugstore, is the Little Bookshop, so named not for its size, but after its owner, Joyce Little. Mr. Sargent doesn't seem to care much for her."
msgstr "沿著吉爾曼旅社旁的路往下走，擠過慘淡的餐廳和藥店，就到了小利透書店。這家書店的名字倒不是因為佔地小，而是因為店主名叫喬伊斯·小利透。但薩金特先生似乎並不怎麼喜歡她。"

msgid "To the north, along the Manuxet, is the Marsh Refining Company, the centerpiece of the town's only industry. Joe speaks of its owner, Barnabas—whom he calls \"Old Man Marsh\"—with a measure of reverence and admiration."
msgstr "沿著馬奴賽特河往北，就到了馬什精煉公司，村子裡唯一產業的核心。一提到公司的老闆巴納巴斯——人稱“老馬什”，喬就帶著一股景仰和崇拜。"

msgid "Mr. Sargent tells you to avoid the old bridge along Fish Street, which is collapsed from years of disrepair and now serves only as a haunt for the dispossessed. \"An' don' listen to that drunk, Zadok,\" the bus driver warns. \"'Is tales are jus' that. Tales. Nothin' more.\""
msgstr "薩金特告誡你避開魚街上的舊橋，那裡年久失修，如今只有無家可歸的流浪漢在此遊蕩。“也別瞎聽那老醉鬼扎多克的。”巴士司機警告道，“他扯淡的故事就只是故事。別的啥也不是。”"

msgid "Farther east, past Water Street, lies Innsmouth Harbour. Sargent warns you not to get in the way of the dockworkers or their business, for they are a rowdy bunch who aren't used to outsiders—especially the ironically-named Robert Friendly, whose name Sargent utters with a hint of hostility."
msgstr "東邊遠處，過了水街，就是印斯茅斯港口。薩金特警告你別管碼頭工人和他們的事，這幫人又吵又不喜歡外來者，沒什麼禮貌——尤其是羅伯特·弗蘭得禮(譯者註：“弗蘭得禮”原文為friendly，在英語中代表“友善”)——他這名字可真是諷刺極了。薩金特提到這名字的時候，語氣可不太友好。"

msgid "To the north, on New Church Green, there exists an old Masonic Hall, now given over to an organization referred to as the \"Esoteric Order of Dagon.\" What truly goes on inside this old, decrepit building is anyone's guess."
msgstr "北邊的新格林教堂本來是一座共濟會的禮堂，但現在已經交給了一個名為“達貢密教”的組織。這棟老舊破房裡面到底發生著什麼根本無人知曉。"

msgid ""
"Finally, Mr. Sargent asks you what you're doing in Innsmouth. You dodge the question with one of your own, asking him if he has seen anybody around town matching Agent Harper's description. He pauses, then shakes his head. \"Never seen 'er,\" he mutters, refusing to meet your gaze.\n"
"You spend the rest of the day learning the layout of the town and attempting in vain to make conversation with the locals. The more time you spend in this strange, squalid town, the more you wish you had never taken Agent Dawson up on his offer. There is something foul in the air here, something rotten and fetid that disturbs you to your core.\n"
"Later that night, you meet up with Agent Dawson in the now-deserted town square and share what you have learned. \"Take a look at this,\" he says, handing you a creased, ink-stained letter addressed to him. \"Turns out Harper had a room at that disgusting old hotel. Still does, technically, but it seemed like she hadn't been around for a few days. I broke in and found this among her things.\"\n"
"Judging from the unmailed letter, it seems Agent Harper knew something in town was tracking her movements. <i>I'm being followed</i>, the missive explains. <i>Don't know how they know, but they know. It's like the whole town is in on something. I have no contacts here whom I trust. I'm going to require more than one agent to sort this out, I fear--</i>\n"
"The letter is cut short. \"Well, she has more than one agent now,\" Dawson says bitterly once you are done reading. \"There's only one reason she wouldn't have sent this letter. Harper's in danger, and somebody in this balled-up town knows where she is.\" Together, you begin to formulate a plan to find Agent Harper. First, narrow down her last known location. Second, find out who knew she was in town. Then… pay them a visit."
msgstr ""
"薩金特最後問你來印斯茅斯幹什麼。你閃爍其詞，轉而描述了一番哈珀特工的特徵，問他在村裡有沒有見過相仿的人。他頓住了，搖了搖頭。“從沒見過。”他嘟囔著躲開了你的眼神。\n"
"這天接下來的時候你都在研究村子的佈局，徒勞無功地試圖和當地人對話。你在這座詭異骯髒的村子裡每多待一分，就越覺得自己不該接下道森特工的案子。這裡的空氣中有什麼汙穢的，腐敗的，惡臭的東西，侵蝕了你的內心。\n"
"夜裡晚些時候，你和道森特工在廣場碰頭，交换信息。此時廣場已經空無一人。“瞧瞧這個。”他說著遞給你一封折起的信。信上墨水浸染，正是寫給他的。“看來哈珀在那棟噁心的老旅社定了個房間。細究起來的話，她的房間還在那兒，只是已經幾天沒見著人了。我闖了進去，在她的東西裡找到了這個。”\n"
"從這封沒有寄出的信看來，哈珀特工知道有人正盯著她的一舉一動。<b>有人跟著我</b>。信上說道。<b>我不知道他們是怎麼發現的，但他們的確發現了。看起來整座村子都參與其中。我在這裡沒有可以相信的線人。要弄清這裡發生的事情，僅僅一名特工是不夠的，我擔心——</b>\n"
"信戛然而止。“好吧，她現在是有不止一名特工了。”你讀完的時候，道森的語氣頗為尖刻。“只有一個解釋能說明她為什麼沒把信寄出。哈珀身陷危險。這混蛋村子裡有人知道她在哪兒。”你們一起制定了尋找哈珀特工的計劃。第一步，縮小範圍，排除出她最後現身的地方。第二步，找出誰知道她在村子裡。然後……敲開這人的大門。"

msgid "Agent Dawson has briefed you on your task and prepared you for this mission. Each investigator may now spend the experience recorded under \"Unspent Experience\" in the Campaign Log."
msgstr "道森特工概述了你的任務，讓你為此做好準備。每位調查員現在可以花費冒險日誌中“未花費經驗值”下方記錄的經驗值。"

You certainly aren't expecting a small leather notebook to slip through the crack under your door, though that's exactly what happens.\n"

It's an old handwritten accound describing the history of the strange town of Innsmouth as far back as the early eighteen hundreds, though the author goes unnamed. The record seems to focus primarily on Obed Marsh's founding of a strange organization called the Esoteric Order of Dagon.

"哈珀翻了個白眼，轉向你：“難以置信，我居然被這傻小子擺了一道。真是我生涯的黑歷史了。”你說或許正是這小夥子笨手笨腳，才讓她放鬆了警惕。“我覺得你是對的。不管了，木已成舟。你對這事兒怎麼看？”她叉著手問道，“這孩子覺得與其違抗‘密教’，還不如襲擊聯邦特工。你覺得他說的是真話嗎？”\n"
"你或許錯估了伯納姆的能力，但比起你來，他肯定更怕密教。你嘆了口氣，點了點頭。\n"
"“好吧，孩子。”哈珀特工說著把男孩拉了起來，“該你講了。把你知道的都說出來。”"

"Othera struggles against her bonds, trying like hell to free herself. \"Let me go! You have to let me go!\" she cries. Agent Harper grins, reveling in this turn of events.\n"
"\"Doesn't feel so good, does it?\" she teases.\n"
"\"You don't understand,\" Othera replies. \"Come. Look. You'll see.\" She motions to the door next to her, which you haven't yet searched. Inside is a stash of oil paintings, dozens and dozens of them, all depicting the same thing: a tumultuous maelstrom in the middle of the ocean, over which the sun and the moon hang in perfect alignment against a red-tinged sky. \"What in the hell…?\" Agent Harper wonders aloud as she sorts through the many reproductions.\n"
"Othera bites her lip, and a single tear streaks down her cheek. \"It's the Order,\" she whispers. \"The Order owns us all.\""

"歐斯拉拼命掙扎著，想要自己解脫束縛。“讓我走！你必須讓我走！”她叫道。哈珀特工笑了，現在情勢逆轉她可是高興極了。\n"
"“這樣的感覺並不好，是吧？”她譏笑道。\n"
"“你什麼都不懂。”歐斯拉回道，“好吧。看吧。你等著瞧。”她指向旁邊一扇你之前沒有搜查過的門。裡面是成打成打的油畫，都畫著同一樣東西：大洋中央狂亂的巨型漩渦，略帶紅色的天空上日月完美排成一線。“這他媽是……？”哈珀特工在諸多複製品中翻找分類的時候大聲發問道。\n"
"歐斯拉咬緊嘴脣，面頰上劃過一滴淚。“是密教。”他低聲說道，“密教掌控了我們所有。"

"Despite her situation, Joyce does little to resist you once you have her restrained. She seems resigned to her fate, her gaze elsewhere as you question her. \"Believe me, if I'd had another method of getting you to back off, I would have used it,\" she says to Agent Harper. \"But you were getting too close. So I did what had to be done.\"\n"
"\"I don't understand. Too close to what, exactly, Ms. Little?\" Harper asks.\n"
"\"There is a secret at the heart of this town. A secret that brings us wealth. A secret that brings us power. A secret that brings us…\" She pauses to find the right words. \"…closer to our destiny.\"\n"
"\"And what kind of secret is that?\" Harper probes.\n"
"Joyce smirks and shakes her head. \"What makes you think I would ever share that with outsiders?\"\n"
"\"Because you assaulted a federal agent, and if you don't tell me what I want to know, your 'destiny' is going to be the inside of a lonely prison cell.\"\n"
"You watch Ms. Little's confidence shatter. She gulps down the last of her pride. A beat of sweat drips down her forehead. \"It started with the Order,\" she explains quietly."

"儘管當前處境不妙，喬伊斯卻沒花什麼大力氣反抗你的拘禁。她看起來已向命運低頭，在你詢問的時候把目光投往別處。“相信我，要是有別的辦法能阻止你，我不會這麼做的。”她對哈珀特工說道，“但你靠得太近。我只能這麼做。”\n"
"“我不明白。到底是靠什麼太近，小利透女士？”哈珀問道。\n"
"“這個村子中藏著一個秘密。這秘密讓我們富有。這秘密讓我們強大。這秘密讓我們……”她頓了頓，想找到正確的說法，“……接近自己的歸宿。”\n"
"“那是什麼秘密呢？”哈珀追問。\n"
"喬伊斯哂笑著搖了搖頭：“你怎麼會覺得，我會跟外來者說這些呢？”\n"
"“因為你襲擊了聯邦特工，要是你不把我想知道的事情都說出來，你的‘歸宿’就是孤零零的牢房。”\n"
"你看到小利透女士的自信瓦解了。她咽下自己最後一絲驕傲，額前淌過一滴冷汗。“都是從密教開始的。”她輕輕地解釋道。"

"Barnabas spits in your face as you attempt to interrogate him. \"I ain't tellin' you a word, interloper,\" he barks, his bulging eyes unblinking as he glowers at you with unbridled hate. \"You don't belong here. All o' your kind'll be dead before the week's end.\"\n"
"Agent Harper narrows her eyes at the strange man's remarks. \"What do you mean by that, Marsh? Our kind? What—outsiders?\"\n"
"Barnabas scowls, his bulbous lips curling back to reveal sharp, inhuman teeth. \"Outsiders. Intruders. You're a blight on our fair town. But you'll be purged soon enough.\"\n"
"You are taken aback by the severity of the old man's threat and his simmering hatred, but Harper simply chortles. \"You call this place 'fair'?\" Ignoring her derision, you warn Barnabas that if he doesn't speak up, he'll be spending a long time behind bars.\n"
"\"Not I,\" he remarks. \"You're the one who'll be locked up, 'n worse. When the Order's done with you, you'll be nothin' but fish food.\"\n"
"You and Harper exchange a knowing glance. She pries further: \"What Order is this, exactly?\""

"就在你要詢問巴納巴斯的時候，他啐了你一口。“我一個字也不會說，入侵者！”他帶著滿滿的恨意瞪著你說道，臌脹的眼睛一眨也不眨。“你不屬於這裡。這週結束前，所有你們這種人都得死。”\n"
"聽到這男人古怪的話語，哈珀特工眯起了眼睛：“你是什麼意思，馬什？我們這種人？哪種——外來者？”\n"
"巴納巴斯怒目而視，他膨脹的嘴脣翻起，露出了非人的尖利牙齒：“外來者。入侵者。你們是咱這美麗小村裡的害蟲。但你們很快就會被清除了。”\n"
"這老人嚴重的威脅和噴薄的恨意將你嚇退一步，但哈珀只是咯咯笑道：“你管這地方叫‘美麗”？”你無視她的嘲笑，警告巴納巴斯他要是不坦白，可就得在牢裡待上不少時候了。\n"
"“我才不會。”他說道，“你們才會給關起來，或者更慘。只要密教抓住你們，你們就得通通餵魚去。”\n"
"你和哈珀交換了一個明瞭的眼神，她更進一步提問：“這個密教到底是什麼？”"

"\"Heh, heh, heh, heh… ye startin' to see haow rott'n this town's got, ain't ye?\" Zadok hollers, a crazed look in his wide eyes. He clutches desperately at your arm, not seeming to care about your attempts to bind him. \"We're all in their clutches now, we are! Heh, heh, heh!\"\n"
"\"What's this blotto have to laugh about?\" Agent Harper mocks. \"Hey, Zadok. Stop it with the nonsense and tell us what your game is.\"\n"
"Zadok rocks back and forth, his voice growing louder and bolder. \"My game? My game?\" he roils with manic laughter. \"Yeh think I'm to blame, but them fish devils are in our midst, they are! Haven't ye seen them?\" He grins. \"Haven't ye seen them monsters crawlin' an' bleatin' an' barkin' an' hoppin' araoun' the black streets? Haven't ye heard the haowlin' errey night from the churches an' the Order o' Dagon Hall? Don'tcha know what's doin' the haowlin'? Eh?

"“呵，呵，呵，呵……你這伙子人想知道這村子有多爛唄，是不？”扎多克瞪大的眼睛裡滿是瘋狂，大聲叫道。他不顧一切地抓住你的胳膊，看起來一點也不在乎你要把他綁住。“俺們今兒個都被抓著了，俺們都是！呵，呵，呵！”\n"
"“這酒鬼到底在笑啥？”哈珀特工嘲笑道，“嘿，扎多克。別莫名其妙地笑了，告訴我們你在玩什麼把戲。”\n"
"扎多克前後搖著，聲音越來越大。“我的把戲？我的把戲？”他被激怒了，狂笑著，“你覺得作怪的是俺，但那些魚魔就在我們中間，就在！你瞧不見他們嗎？”他咧嘴笑道，“你瞧不見妖怪們在黑咕隆咚的街上叫喚，竄來竄去？你聽不著他們每個夜上都在達貢密教的廳堂裡亂嚎？不知他們嚎了些啥？嗯？是嗎？”他的聲音越來越高，化作尖叫，然後又低沉下去，變成一陣大笑。\n"
"“不，我不知道。”哈珀眯起眼睛回道，“不如你給我們解釋解釋？”"

"Robert refruses to say a word until you get him a cigar. You begrudgingly oblige, hoping that your generosity yields dividends. \"I was investigating the docks when he and his cronies nabbed me,\" Agent Harper recounts bitterly. You ask who these \"cronies\" were, and she shrugs. \"Not sure. Dockworkers and sailors, I imagine. Whoever hired Mr. Friendly over here must have a lot of influence over the locals.\"\n"
"After handing Robert the cigar he demanded, you are surprised to find him a little more compliant, though no more friendly despite his name. \"Doesn't matter,\" he mutters, blowing out a puff of rank cigar smoke. \"You're all dead men walking. No offense, miss.\"\n"
"\"Offense taken,\" she bites back. \"Care to tell us what you mean by that?\"\n"
"\"The Order,\" he replies with a quiet, unwavering resolve. \"They know everything that happens in this town. Probably out lookin' for me right now. You sure you wanna be here when they find me?\" He flashes a sadistic grin.\n"
"Harper doesn't flinch. \"Yeah, actually. I think I do,\" she replies, cracking her knuckles. \"Now start talking.\""

"羅伯特表示他什麼都不會說，除非你給他一支菸。你不情不願地給了他，希望自己這番大方能有所回報。“他們這幫貨色抓住我的時候，我正調查碼頭呢。”哈珀特工憤懣地說道。你問她“這幫貨色”指的是什麼，而她聳了聳肩：“不確定。碼頭工和水手吧，我猜。能在這兒僱弗蘭得禮的人，不管是誰，在當地肯定都很有勢力。”\n"
"你把香菸給了羅伯特之後，驚訝地發現他確實合作了一點，儘管還是一樣名不副實，沒有禮貌。“無所謂。”他低聲說道，吐出一口難聞的煙，“你們都已經是死人了。無意冒犯，女士。”\n"
"“冒犯到了。”她回擊道，“你介意告訴我們那是什麼意思嗎？”\n"
"“密教。”他雖然聲音不大，卻有一種不可動搖的決心，“村子裡發生了什麼他們都知道。興許現在就在外面找我呢。你真的想在他們找到我的時候，還待在這兒嗎？”他露出一個殘忍的獰笑。\n"
"哈珀毫無畏懼：“嗯，確實。我倒是想。”她說著按扭指節，“現在，快說。”"
