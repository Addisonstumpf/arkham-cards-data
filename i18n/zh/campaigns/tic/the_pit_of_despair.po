"Your eyes flutter open with the languor of one who has slept for days on end. Your senses are in no hurry to return. You blink and struggle to see through the inky black surrounding you. Every inch of you aches with dull, throbbing pain. Your skin is cold and numb, and your clothes are waterlogged. Your mind swims with half-articulated thoughts and tangled memories. You have no idea where you are or how you got here.\n"
"You snap to attention, heart racing in your chest. You lie on a jagged stone floor in a shallow pool of dark, ice-cold water. Knowing panic will only make the situation worse, you take a series of deep, meditative breaths. you try to remember something—anything—that might allow you to retrace your steps, but your mind is blank. You remember who you are, but nothing whatsoever from the recent past. You steady yourself and examine your surroundings.\n"
"The chamber appears to be a natural cave formation. Kelp dangles from the ceiling. The stone walls and floor are wet and slimy. A rhythmic drip, drip, drip echoes throughout the otherwise silent cave. This cavern has been underwater, and not too long ago. A result of the tides, perhaps? You swallow your fear like a lump of cold iron. If it is low tide now… A cold shudder ripples up your spine. You examine the ceiling and are surprised to see a slab of metal set into the rough stone overhead. Its polished surface is alien to the rest of the natural cavern. You call out for help, hoping somebody can hear.\n"
"Your dread deepens at the reply: an awful croaking and gurgling that permeates the tunnels—a sound no human could make."

"你掙扎著睜開雙眼，疲憊得彷彿已經沉睡數日。你的知覺還未完全恢復。你眨眨眼，拼命想看清身邊的一團墨黑。你身上每一寸都傳來陣陣鈍痛。你的皮膚冰冷麻木，衣服溼溼漉漉。你的腦海裡迴盪著四分五裂的思緒和支離破碎的記憶。你不知道自己是誰，也不明白自己為何會在這兒。\n"
"你猛地回過神來，胸膛裡心臟狂跳。你躺在參差的石地上，周圍是淺淺一灘冰冷的黑水。你知道驚慌失措只會讓情況更糟，深呼吸了一陣，集中精神。你試著想起什麼——任何東西——任何能讓你回溯的東西，但你的腦海一片空白。你記起了自己是誰，但最近的事情你卻怎麼都想不起來。你穩住心神，查看周圍。\n"
"這個空間看起來像是自然形成的洞穴。頂上垂下了水藻。石壁和地面潮溼黏滑。萬籟俱寂，唯有水滴的迴響還頗有些節奏。整座洞穴在不久之前都曾在水下。也許是潮汐的結果？你咽下自己的恐懼，彷彿生吞一塊寒鐵。如果現在恰是退潮之時……想到這裡，一陣寒顫穿透脊背。你仔細查看天頂，卻驚訝地發現頭上粗糙的石板裡嵌著金屬板。那光滑的表面和天然形成的洞窟格格不入。你呼喊求救，希望有人能聽到。\n"
"但得到的回應只讓你更為恐懼——隧道間穿過一汨咕呱之聲——能發出這聲音的絕非人類。"

"You stand in a small office, examining a worn photograph in a well-polished wooden frame. In the photo, a squad of men in military uniforms pose in front of a Bristol F.2 Fighter plane. Several of the men wear tan British uniforms, but one sports the olive overcoat and khakis of an American soldier. His sleeves each bear a rectangular patch striped vertically with a captain's paired silver bars. At the bottom of the photograph, in black ink, cursive handwriting reads \"British Fourth Army, outside St. Quentin, 1918.\"\n"
"The door to the office opens suddenly, startling you. You put the photograph down and turn to address the man entering. You identify him immediately by his dark-brown skin, his strong jaw, and his broad shoulders. It is Thomas Dawson—the American from the photograph—though he has aged a bit since his war days, and heavy bags hang under his eyes. \"One war ends; a new one begins,\" he says quietly. \"Only this enemy is even harder to root out.\"\n"
"You ask the man what a war hero is doing in the investigative business, and he chuckles softly in response. \"War hero? I don't know where you heard that from. I was just doing my duty.\" You shake your head but do not argue further. You suspect that the squadron Captain Dawson rescued would disagree as well.\n"
"\"In any event, I suppose you're wondering why I summoned you here to Boston,\" he says, gesturing for you to take a seat in front of his desk. You sit and respond to his remark with affirmation, wondering aloud why a telephone call would not have sufficed. \"This is a… sensitive matter,\" he replies. \"A few days ago, I lost contact with one of my agents, a Miss Elina Harper. I had her investigating several strange reports I've received in the past few months, all concerning a town called Innsmouth. Do you know the place? It's along the coast to the north of your town of Arkham, just by Ipswich.\"\n"
"You know the place. Though most have never heard of the shadowed, decrepit seaport, those who do hear only ill rumors. From what you understand, the town used to be lively port before the War of 1812, but it has since become dingy and run-down. The only railway line that runs through Innsmouth is abandoned, and there are no references to the town on any maps or in any guidebooks you have ever seen.\n"
"\"Perhaps she's found something curious or has gone into hiding, but I suspect foul play. It could be mob work, but I doubt it. I'm not sending any more agents until I know for sure. However, I have some room in our discretionary budget to hire a third party, such as yourself.\" You assume Agent Dawson is dancing around the truth, which is that you are expendable. \"I know it isn't much to go on, but I need to know the status of Agent Harper. Even bad news would be better than no news, at this point. If you do me this favor, our agency will be in your debt.\" You ask which agency Dawson is referring to. A smirk tugs at his lips.\n"
"When you snap back to the present, you still gaze at Agent Dawson's face, only his smirk is twisted in a haunting visage of agony. It is just one of the many faces that writhe in torment throughout this repulsive creature's scaly, pulsating flesh."

"你站在一間小小的辦公室裡，打量著精緻木框裡的老照片。照片上是一隊穿著軍服的男子，正站在一架布里斯托F.2戰鬥機前擺著拍照的姿勢。其中幾個穿著棕色的英國軍服，而有一個得意地穿著橄欖色的外套和美軍的卡其布軍服。他兩邊的肩章上都是上尉的一對銀杠。照片底部用黑色墨水潦草地寫著“英國第四集團軍，聖康坦市外，1918年。”\n"
"房間的門突然打開，嚇了你一跳。你放下照片，轉過來朝著進門的男子。他古銅色的皮膚，堅實的下巴和寬厚的肩膀，讓你一下子就認出來了。這就是托馬斯·道森——照片上的美國人。只不過他看起來比戰時蒼老了一些，眼睛下面也掛上了沉重的眼袋。“舊的戰爭結束了，新的戰爭又已開始。”他輕輕說著，“但這一次的敵人更難根除。”\n"
"你問他大戰的英雄如今怎麼幹起了調查行當，而他只是輕輕一笑以作回應。“大戰的英雄？我可不知道你這是從哪兒聽來的。我只是在盡自己的職責。”你搖搖頭，並未爭辯。只是你覺得道森上尉救下的飛行中隊可不會同意他的說法。\n"
"“無論如何，我想你正好奇為什麼我得把你叫到波士頓來。”他說著示意你在桌前落座。你乖乖坐下，並坦言確實如此，提問有什麼事不能在電話裡說。“這……可還挺敏感。”他答道，“幾天前，我和自己的特工艾蓮娜·哈珀女士失去了聯繫。我派她去調查過去幾個月裡收到的奇怪報告，這些報告都提到一個名叫印斯茅斯的村子。你知道這地方嗎？從你們阿卡姆鎮沿著海岸往北，就靠著伊普斯威奇。”\n"
"你倒確實知道這地方。儘管大多數人都從未聽說這個陰暗衰敗的海港，知道的寥寥幾人聽到的也都是不祥的流言。你印象中的印斯茅斯，在1812年戰爭之前還是一座生機勃勃的港口，但打那以後，就開始蕭條昏暗。唯一穿過印斯茅斯的鐵路已經廢棄，你能找到的地圖和導覽手冊上都找不見它的身影。\n"
"“興許她是找到了什麼不尋常的事情，又或者藏了起來。但我懷疑情況可能不妙。興許是惹上了黑幫，但這也不太可能。在確定情況之前，我不會再派別的特工。不過，我的預算裡還有點活動空間，可以僱傭第三方——比如，你。”你覺得道森特工並沒有跟你掏心窩子。說白了，就是你出事也沒什麼大不了。“現在的情況的確還不明朗，但我得知道哈珀特工的情況。現在壞消息也好過沒消息。要是你幫我這個忙，‘組織’就算欠你的。”你問道森“組織”指的是什麼。但他只咧嘴一個壞笑。\n"
"你猛地回到現實，眼前依然是道森特工那張臉，只是壞笑的表情已扭曲成徘徊不去的痛苦。這張臉和眾多面龐一起，在這可怕怪物長鱗鼓動的血肉上痛苦翻滾。"

"You reply that you have seen nothing quite like it before, but it does happen to match the descriptions you have heard of the \"devils\" that skulk about the reefs a couples of miles beyond the harbour. \"Something fishy is going on here, if you'll pardon my saying,\" the man mutters, folding his arms across his chest. \"I'm glad I roped you in on this case.

Its large, round eyes glare at you. In the distance, you hear the faint chanting of some kind of ceremony. \"Y'ha-nthlei! Y'ha-nthlei!\" the voices cry.
