"As soon as your mind returned to the present, you began formulating your plan. A plan to enter the realm of the Deep Ones and end their conspiracy once and for all. \"This is ridiculous, you know that, right?\" Harper asks. You nod. Of course it's ridiculous. You've spent the last two days on the run. Chased. Hunted. Tormented.\n"
"But you've also spend the last two days recovering the memories you've forgotten. And what you've seen is something you can't possibly ignore. You have seen the deity the Esoteric Order of Dagon is named for, and you understand what the Order plans to do. The alignment of the celestial bodies in the sky, the steadily rising tides, the tumultuous fluctuating weather, the creatures emerging from the deep, all of it is tied together. You have seen it. There will come a flood, a great disaster to wipe out humanity, so only the deep remains. The great city in the reef shall rise once more and become the beating heart of all life on Earth.\n"
"There are still gaps in your memory, but all this you know to be true. All of Innsmouth is consumed by this conspiracy. The Order controlled the town through its oaths and the secret wealth it hoarded from the deep. It was no wonder they treated outsiders like yourself with such scorn.\n"
"You give Harper a knowing glare. She sighs and nods. \"I know. It's the only way.\" Together, the two of you plot your course. Abandoned ships still litter the harbor of Innsmouth. Under the cover of night, you must commandeer one of them, sail to Devil Reef, and descend once more into the antediluvian ruins in the depths below the forsaken islands. That is where the other entrance to the city lies. Y'ha-nthlei.\n"
"Your skin prickles with cold shivers as you utter the word aloud. Harper grimaces, though you can sense the determination behind her steely gaze. \"I'm going to see this mission through, Dawson. For you.\"\n"
"You lay out all of the information you've uncovered and the relics you've obtained despite the horrors arrayed against you. You know the way to Y'ha-nthlei is sealed tight. There must be a way to gain entrance. Perhaps you already have the answers you seek…"

"你的意識一回到現在，就開始構思下一步的計劃。構思要怎麼進入深潛者領域，一勞永逸地終結這場暗潮。“這可真是荒謬。是吧？”哈珀問道。你點點頭。這當然荒謬。你過去兩天都疲於奔命。疲於追兵。疲於獵手。疲於折磨。\n"
"但你已經花了兩天恢復忘卻的記憶。你瞧見的東西肯定不能忽略。你已經看見了達貢密教得名的神靈，理解了密教到底想幹什麼。排列一線的天體，不斷上漲的浪潮，狂怒起伏的天氣，深海湧現的怪物，這些如今都聯繫起來了。你看見了。將會有一場大洪災掃除全人類，所留唯有深海。礁石中的巨城將再度升起，成為世界上所有生命的鼓動心臟。\n"
"雖然你的記憶仍有空缺，但你所知的一切確是實事。整個印斯茅斯都被暗潮吞沒。密教用誓約和深海潛藏的秘密財富控制了整個村鎮。他們為何如此輕蔑地對待像你一樣的外來者，也就不足為奇了。\n"
"你向哈珀投去一個了然的眼神。她嘆了口氣，點了點頭：“我明白。只有這一條路。”你倆共商大計。印斯茅斯的碼頭上還散著廢棄的船隻。在夜色下，你們肯定能搶上一艘開到魔鬼礁石去，再次潛入遺忘島嶼底下深處的洪荒古城。這裡就是城市的另一個入口。伊哈·恩斯雷。\n"
"你大聲說話的時候，皮膚一陣冷顫和刺痛。哈珀擠了個苦臉，但你能察覺到她冷峻的眼神中包含的決心。“我會讓任務完成的，道森。就當是為了你。”\n"
"儘管恐懼襲來，但你還是將自己發現的所有信息全然吐露，也拿出了自己找到的遺物。你知道通往伊哈·恩斯雷的道路已嚴密封印。但肯定還有辦法能進去。也許你已經找到了自己想要的答案……"

msgid "You study the trophy you found in the sacrificial pit in which you awoke several days ago—part of what was once the creature that you fought in Devil Reef. It wasn't the same kind of creature as the \"Deep Ones\" that the Esoteric Order of Dagon worships, but you cannot help ruminating over the similarities between them. You recall that fish never cease growing as they age, and wonder if the same may be true for Deep Ones. Perhaps it was an ancient breed of Deep Ones—something so old, it grew enormous and twisted beyond imagination. If so what was it doing in Devil Reef? Was it guarding Y'ha-nthlei? And if so, what does that bode for you? You decide to take the trophy with you, hoping it is important enough to aid in your mission…"
msgstr "你研究了自己幾週前在犧牲深坑中找到的戰利品——也就是你曾在魔鬼礁石搏鬥過的怪物。這和達貢密教崇拜的“深潛者”不是一類生物，但你不禁開始思考他們之間的相似性。你回想起魚的生長永無休止，好奇深潛者是否也是如此。也許這是一種古代的深潛者——過於古老，已經長得超越想象的龐大和扭曲。如果真是如此，那它在魔鬼礁石是為何？它是在守衛伊哈·恩斯雷嗎？若真是如此，這對你來說又意味著什麼？你決定帶著戰利品上路，希望它足夠重要，能在任務中幫上忙……"

Now the relic recognizes you as its rightful heir. Perhaps with this, you will be able to gain entrance to Y'ha-nthlei…"
