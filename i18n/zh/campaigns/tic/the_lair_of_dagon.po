"You stand outside the cracked marble steps leading up to the masonic hall of the Esoteric Order of Dagon. All of the evidence has lead you here. Whatever is going on in this town, this Order is behind it. You're sure of it… though their ultimate goal remains a mystery.\n"
"The town is eerily quiet as you stand before the building's entrance. Once, this place might have been impressive and opulent. Years of disrepair and flood damage have reduced it to a near-ruin. Its once-white paint is gray and peeling, and many of the pillars outside the entryway are beginning to crumble. Still, it is one of the more intimidating places in Innsmouth, projecting authority despite its decrepitude. No, not authority—something darker. A looming, unspoken threat.\n"
"\"Are you ready?\" Agent Dawson asks. His usually calm demeanor has vanished, replaced with a humorless gravity that throws you off guard. \"This is it. This is where we'll find answers.\"\n"
"You're not so sure. Every other lead you've followed has led to only more questions."

"你站在破損的大理石階梯外，這裡直通向達貢密教的共濟會禮堂。所有的證據都把你引向這裡。無論村子裡發生了什麼，背後肯定都是密教。你對此十分確定……但密教的最終目的仍然是謎。\n"
"你站在這幢建築門前的時候，村子裡一片詭異的寂靜。這地方過去肯定壯觀華麗。但年久失修，又有洪水侵蝕，這裡已經快成了一片廢墟。曾經雪白的牆壁如今發灰剝落，入口外許多立柱也開始坍圮。儘管已經老舊，但這仍是村子裡最為威嚴的建築，彰顯著權威。不，不是權威——是什麼更為黑暗的東西。一種若隱若現、難以言喻的威脅。\n"
"“你準備好了嗎？”道森特工問道。他尋常的冷靜已經消失，如今毫無幽默的嚴肅倒是讓你措手不及。“就是這兒了。這兒就是我們找到答案的地方。”\n"
"對此你可不敢確定。你追蹤的其他線索，每一條都只是引出了更多的問題。"

"Agent Harper was kidnapped when she got too close to the Order, but interrogating her kidnapper didn't exactly yield the answers you needed. What you know now is that the Order's influence pervades Innsmouth, from important civic figures to everyday citizens. Finances, religion, politics… everything is wrapped up in this cult's business in some way or another. What's worse, many of the town's inhabitants seem to follow the Order with blind, fanatical devotion. So many that you're not sure this is even a functioning town anymore. It's no wonder the people are so hostile towards outsiders.\n"
"It wasn't until your investigation of Devil Reef that you truly began to peel away the outer layers of Innsmouth and reveal the rot beneath. There, you found what the Order was hiding: the monstrous creatures that emerged from the depths and prowled the tidal islands, congregating in prayers to some horrific deity. Perhaps it is even the same \"Dagon\" worshipped by the Order."

"哈珀特工接近密教的時候遭到了綁架，但盤問她的綁匪並沒有給出你想要的答案。你現在知道密教的影響力已經滲入了印斯茅斯，從重要的大人物到日常小民。金融、宗教、政治……這個密教已經用各種手段纏上了每件事。更糟的是，許多村民都盲目、狂熱地向密教獻身。這樣的人太多，以至於你根本無法確認這個村子是否還正常。毫無疑問，這裡的人對外來者並無善意。\n"
"直到調查了魔鬼礁石，你才真正抽絲剝繭，揭開了印斯茅斯的外皮，發現了底下潛藏的腐敗。你在那兒發現了密教隱藏的東西：從海底湧現的怪異生物。它們逡巡於岸邊的礁島，一同向駭人的神靈祈禱。或許就是密教崇拜的同一個“達貢”。"

Your own investigation might have ended the same way had you not laid low for a week after the townsfolk got riled up. It seems that the Order's influence pervades Innsmouth, from important civic figures to everyday citizens. Finances, religion, politics… everything is wrapped up in this cult's business in some way or another. But why?\n"

"You're somewhere else now, lying on your stomach on cold, damp stone. Your arms are held tight behind your back. You have no idea how you got here. As consciousness returns, your vision comes into focus. You crane your neck up to view your surroundings, but it's too dark to see anything inside your stone cell.\n"
"\"I'll ask you one last time. Who sent you here?\" a voice asks. It is deep and husky, like the croaking of a frog.\n"
"You hear the familiar, cool baritone of Agent Dawson reply: \"Your breath smells awful. Ever heard of brushing your teeth?\" Despite the sarcasm dripping from his words, his voice wavers ever so slightly.\n"
"\"Your mockery only masks the fear that hides within,\" the voice replies. \"Very well. If you are of no use to us, you will be the first to be sacrificed.\"\n"
"Your vision continues to adjust. You can just barely make out Dawson's silhouette on the other side of the cell. He is kneeling before a metal hatch in the stone floor. An elderly robed figure presses a curved knife against Dawson's throat. Someone lifts the hatch, and Dawson's eyes go wide. He gives you one last despairing look, shakes his head slowly and deliberately, and quietly slides something across the stone floor. Then the hooded figure pushes him in. In the scuffle and the low light, nobody notices the car key that skitters to a halt directly next to you.\n"
"You grab the key and stuff it into your pocket just before you are shoved forward. Two more sets of cold, clammy hands grasp your shoulders, and the hooded figure slides his knife up to your neck. All you can see of his face are his wide, unblinking eyes.\n"
"\"Oceiros, these ones were found in Dagon's lair as well,\" another voice explains to the elderly figure in the robes. \"We believe they were the ones snooping around Devil Reef.\"\n"
"The man with the knife to your throat nods. \"Your turn,\" he declares. \"Tell us why you have come and perhaps we will let you go. Who sent you? What have you seen?\""

"“我再問你最後一遍。是誰派你來的？”一個聲音問道。這聲音低沉沙啞，彷彿青蛙的咕呱。\n"
"你聽到了道森特工熟悉、冷酷的男低音：“你聞起來真是糟透了。你聽說過‘刷牙’這回事嗎？”儘管他言辭犀利，但音調的變化甚微。\n"
"“你的嘲弄不過是在掩飾自己的恐懼。”那個聲音答道，“也罷。既然你派不上用場，那就拿你做第一個祭品。”\n"
"你的視線開始適應了。你勉強能看出廳室另一端道森的身影。他跪在石頭地板上一個金屬活板門前。一個披著長袍的老者將彎刀抵在道森的喉嚨上。有人打開了門，道森瞪大了眼睛。他最後向你投來一個絕望的眼神，緩緩地、刻意地搖了搖頭，然後將什麼東西悄悄地滑過石地面。然後那個披著長袍的人就把他推了進去。在扭打的喧囂和如此暗沉的燈光之中，沒人注意到一路劃過地面的車鑰匙停在了你面前。\n"
"你抓起鑰匙，塞進口袋。剛做完你就被推上前去。一雙冰冷溼黏的手抓住了你的肩膀，長袍人將刀子抵在了你的脖子上。他的臉上你能看到的就是那雙不會眨的大眼睛。\n"
"“奧賽羅思，這人也是在達貢巢穴裡找到的。”另一個聲音向披著長袍的老者解釋道，“我們覺著這就是在魔鬼礁石刺探的人了。”\n"
