"There have been reports of strange occurrences at Arkham’s Excelsior Hotel for over a month now. Disappearances. Bizarre sightings. Sudden closures, sometimes for days at a time, seemingly without warning. It’s like something out of a ghost story, but you know better than to simply dismiss these rumors. Too many people have whispered about the Excelsior…and to make matters worse, it seems the stories have only grown more unsettling in the last week. It’s time somebody looked into it all.\n"
"You’ve tried going to the police, but the grizzled and world‑weary Sergeant Monroe has dismissed you every time. You’ve been left to investigate on your own. Asking around at all the local hot-spots yields no leads. Velma’s Diner, Hibb’s Roadhouse, La Bella Luna; Each visit leaves you with only more questions. That is, until today.\n"
"While walking down Central Avenue in Downtown, minding your own business, you bump into a man in a long trench coat. You begin to apologize, but he simply continues walking briskly away from you. It isn’t until you return home that you find the note in your pocket—one that wasn’t there before.\n"

"一個多月以來，坐落於阿卡姆的「埃賽希爾酒店」已經傳出了多起奇怪事件的報導。失蹤事件、奇異的目擊事件、有時忽然無預警的閉館數日。雖然聽起來就像是一則鬼故事，但你知道最好不要輕忽這些傳聞。已經有太多人到處議論著這件事了……而更糟的是，這些詭異的故事在過去一個禮拜反而越演越烈，該是有人介入調查的時候了。\n"
"你曾試著連絡警方，但是頭髮蒼白又厭倦世事的門羅警長每次都將你的請求打了回票，你只能獨自展開調查。在當地各處熱點訪查並沒有讓你得到太多線索，維爾瑪餐館、希伯酒館、月下美人；每一次的訪查都只讓你徙增了更多疑問，至到今天。\n"
"當你今日漫步在市中心的中央大道，正想著自己的事情時，你迎面撞上了一名身穿長風衣的男子。你開口道歉，但他只是自顧自地走了。直到你回到家，才發現你的口袋中有著一張原本並不存在的紙條。\n"

Hotel staff carry luggage and cleaning supplies throughout the lobby and the main stairway. The man behind the front desk greets you with a curt nod and a thin smile. A uniformed security guard reads the latest Arkham Advertiser in the corner. And yet, you can’t get the note’s final warning out of your mind.\n"
"You stride quickly across the lobby and up the stairs, wondering if you should have let someone know where you were going. Was it wise to come alone? What if you’re walking into a trap?

The entire time, you find yourself glancing to the coffee table in front of you, and the curved dagger that rests there. He pauses for a moment, pours himself a drink, and raises the glass to his lips with a shaky grip. He then pours a second drink and hands it to you. “This is all going to sound crazy,” he says, his voice little more than a whisper. He glances at every darting shadow and twitches at every creak the old building makes. “I’m beginning to feel crazy, but there’s too much going on here to just ignore. And I’ve been a part of it long enough…” You listen closely, but his words are starting to run together. His voice is ethereal and wispy, like wind at the end of a long tunnel. You blink rapidly. Your vision blurs. The next thing you know, you’re on your feet. Your glass drops to the floor, and then—"

"Nobody will ever believe what you witnessed at the Excelsior. Not three days later, the hotel was open again, like nothing had ever happened. You know better, though. You witnessed it all firsthand. The events continue to haunt your dreams and your waking thoughts. Even now you go out of your way to avoid the Excelsior, though weeks have passed and there has been no sign of any other nefarious schemes within its accursed walls. The only thing that can quiet the echoing memories of that horrible experience is a visit to the local speakeasy. But all the booze in the world can’t keep the grisly visions from your nightmares, waking you in the dead of night with a violent start, soaked in sweat. That’s when you notice the person asking around town about the Excelsior. Innocent questions, at first, but more prodding with each passing day. Surely they will believe you. Somebody has to. You may have broken free of the Excelsior’s grasp, but there will be other victims, of that you are sure. You grab a piece of paper and hastily scribble a note.\n"

"“Sit there any longer and I’ll have to charge you rent.” You blink rapidly, as if coming out of a deep dream. Looking up, you see a waiter giving you an annoyed look. He is carrying a stack of dirty dishes. In your hand is a glass of water. You don’t remember ordering it, nor do you remember how long you’ve been here. And where <i>is</i> here, exactly? You spin around in your chair and realize you’re in the restaurant of the Excelsior Hotel. A few other diners are present, catching an early dinner and minding their own business. The soft light of an autumn afternoon filters in through the windows, and the general din of activity can be heard from the lobby. You turn and briefly glance back at the waiter before reaching in your pocket and dropping a quarter on the table, heading for the lobby. Your legs feel like jelly. As you stumble out of the restaurant, other guests view you with concern. The security guard in the corner watches you like a hawk. You head over to the front desk, steadying yourself against it. The concierge approaches, but you recoil at the recognition of his face. The hotel is operating as if nothing happened. But that can’t be. Everything you saw was true, right? You dash out the front door before he can reach you. You have to put some distance between yourself and this accursed place.\n"
"Weeks pass. Nothing helps to quell the feeling in your mind that you have missed something important. This business with the Excelsior is not done, not by a long shot. You begin your investigation anew, asking around town for the latest rumors regarding the hotel. More missing staff. More sudden closures. Guests who never arrived. Guests who <i>never</i> left. It’s all too much.\n"
"Standing on a lonely street corner in Northside, you consider your options. Streetlamps flicker to life around you as evening creeps in. Just then, a stranger bumps into you, muttering a half-hearted apology. You take a step after them before you feel something tugging at the back of your mind. No. Could it be? You stick your hands into your coat pocket. Stuffed inside is a small, folded note. You look up, but the pedestrian is nowhere in sight. You unfold the note slowly, fingers shaking from anxiety and fear.\n"
