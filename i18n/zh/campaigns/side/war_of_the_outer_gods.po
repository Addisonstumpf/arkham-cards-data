"Over a decade after the Great War, another kind of war has come to Earth—a conflict wrought by factions long hidden in the shadows of society.\n"
"It began with the murders in Arkham—over a dozen bodies in half as many days. The police thought the perpetrator to be a serial killer at first, until the sixth victim's corpse turned up as a mangled heap of meat and viscera, like a meal chewed up and spit back out. No human could have performed such a grisly murder.\n"
"When similar killings started to sprout up in other cities across North America, you sought to uncover the truth. A serial killer could not be in Arkham, Providence, Montréal, and New York City all at once. This had to be the work of an organization. But that wasn't all you discovered: there were commonalities between many of the victims, sorting them into three distinct groups.\n"
"In Providence, many victims were older and well-educated. In Montréal, those killed lived in the woods outside the city, or had professions dealings with nature or biology in some capacity. In New York, bodies turned up deep in the sewers and underground subway tunnels, their identities shrouded in mystery.\n"
"You have spent the past few weeks trying to unearth the truth behind these murders and the various factions carrying them out. In this time, the conflict has grown exponentially. Massacres. Bombings. Sightings of strange ceremonies in the streets. Entities blotting out the stars in the night sky. Swarms of locust-like insects devouring people whole. Mutated lizard creatures prowling the sewers. And worse yet, while Arkham seems to be conflict's epicenter, these incidents are spreading all across the world.\n"
"This is no ordinary war, and not one the authorities can deal with. You are the only one who suspects the truth. Somehow, you have to find out what these factions are fighting over, and put a stop to the conflict before it consumes the entire world in its madness."

"在普羅維登斯，受害者多是受過良好教育的老年人。在蒙特利爾，死者生前居住在城市以外的樹林裡，或者生前從事與自然或生物有關的職業。在紐約，屍體發現於下水道和地鐵隧道的深處，身份依然成謎。\n"

As the planet's core plunges to absolute zero, all life is instantly snuffed out. From the opening made by the nexus on Earth, the entity then stretches out to all corners of the solar system, devouring all warmth along the way. Nothing can stop it now."
msgstr "地球只是第一個被西勒諾斯吞噬的星球——它是空天的化身，萬事萬物貪婪的終結。當這個星球的核心温度降至冰點，所有生命立即被扼殺殆盡。從地球聯結點所形成的開口開始，那團迷霧延伸到了太陽系的每個角落，沿途吞噬了一切熱量。如今無人再能阻止它了。"

msgid "The beast's rampage is impossible to stop. You were the only ones with any knowledge of how to defeat the thing. One by one, as it makes its way across continents and through the oceans, cities fall. Armies are obliterated. Governments collapse. The monstrous creatures hatched by the cult of Ark'at continue their ravenous war until there is nothing left to rule over but the vast wastes of Earth and the crumbling ruins of human civilization. The \"paradise\" they so willingly killed for has come."
msgstr "這頭野獸的橫衝直撞無法阻擋，只有你知道如何才能擊敗它。它穿過大陸和海洋，沿路的城市接連崩塌。軍隊均被消滅。政府紛紛倒台。阿卡特教團孕育出來的怪物仍未停止他們貪婪的征戰，直到地球上除了遼闊的廢土與人類文明搖搖欲墜的廢墟之外，再沒有東西可供他們支配。他們甘願為之犧性的“樂園”已經到來。"
