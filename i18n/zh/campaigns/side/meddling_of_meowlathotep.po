msgid "Barkham Horror"
msgstr "狗鎮奇談"

msgid "<i>Barkham Horror</i> is an alternate universe in which the conflict between humanity and the eldritch forces of the mythos takes a back seat, and the conflict between dogs and cats takes center stage."
msgstr "在《狗鎮奇談》的平行宇宙中，人類與神秘力量之間的衝突退居次要位置，而狗與貓之間的矛盾站上了舞台中央。"

msgid "Investigator and player cards included in <i>Barkham Horror</i> expansions cannot be used in traditional <i>Arkham Horror: The Card Game</i> scenarios."
msgstr "《狗鎮奇談》擴展中的調查員卡和玩家卡不能用於傳統《詭鎮奇談：卡牌遊戲》的冒險。"

msgid "Likewise, only investigators from <i>Barkham Horror</i> expansions should be used while playing a <i>Barkham Horror</i> scenario. Other player cards from any <i>Arkham Horror: The Card Game</i> product may be used."
msgstr "同樣地，進行《狗鎮奇談》冒險的遊戲時只能使用《狗鎮奇談》擴展裡的調查員。可以使用任意《詭鎮奇談：卡牌遊戲》產品中的其他玩家卡。"

msgid "Each time an investigator fails a skill test while attempting to evade an enemy with the alert keyword, after applying all results for that skill test, that enemy performs an attack against the evading investigator. An enemy does not exhaust after performing an alert attack. This attack occurs whether the enemy is engaged with the evading investigator or not."
msgstr "每當調查員在試圖躲避一名帶有警戒關鍵詞的敵人時技能檢定失敗，在結算該技能檢定帶來的所有後果之後，該敵人對進行躲避的調查員執行一次攻擊。敵人執行警戒攻擊後不被消耗。不論該敵人是否與進行躲避的調查員交戰，此類攻擊均會發生。"

msgid "“Lousy with cats”"
msgstr "“佈滿貓咪”"

msgid "Six of the locations in this scenario begin play with a facedown [[Meowsk]] enemy beneath them. During this scenario, a location with a facedown encounter card beneath it is “lousy with cats.” <b>This has no inherent game effect.</b> However, some card effects may change depending on whether or not a location is lousy with cats."
msgstr "遊戲開始時，本場冒險的6個地點底下各有一張正面向下的[[貓怪]]敵人。在本場冒險中，一個地點若底下帶有正面朝下的遭遇卡，稱這個地點“佈滿貓咪”。<b>“佈滿貓咪”本身不帶有遊戲效果。</b>但是，某些遊戲效果會根據一個地點是否佈滿貓咪而發生改變。"

msgid "If the encounter card beneath a location that is lousy with cats enters play or is removed for any reason, that location is no longer lousy with cats."
msgstr "如果一個佈滿貓咪的地點底下的遭遇卡因為任何原因入場或被移除，該地點不再佈滿貓咪。"

msgid "“Sniffing” Locations"
msgstr "“嗅”地點"

msgid "Dogs have a fantastic sense of smell. Kate Winthpup in particular has an ability that allows her to “sniff ” a location. You may wish to use a token (such as a resource token) or a piece of scrap paper to record which locations you’ve sniffed. In general, once you sniff a location, it is sniffed for the rest of the game."
msgstr "狗狗都有著出色的嗅覺。凱特·溫斯波比有一種特別的能力，能夠“嗅”一個地點。你不妨使用一個標記(例如資源標記)或是一張紙片來記錄你嗅過的地點。一般來說，一旦你嗅了一個地點，在接下來的遊戲當中這個地點就是被嗅過的。"

"It is a dark and stormy night in the storied and haunted city of Barkham. By the time you hit the streets, it is raining cats and dogs. But you’ve picked up the scent of something big, and once you sink your teeth into a story, you just can’t let go. A little wet fur has never stopped you from finding the truth.\n"
"Strange happenings have been going on in Barkham. Cat sightings are at an all-time high, and each day more and more pigeons go missing. While this wouldn’t normally be newsworthy, you know that there is more to this story than meets the eye. After all, while a few cats are harmless and adorable, most are nefarious schemers. You have heard the whispers and the howls on the wind. The Order of Dead Rodents on the Doorstep is back, and whatever they are plotting, only you can stop it.\n"
"You’re heading back to your home in Slobbertown—the Barkham neighborhood closest to the docks—when you catch a whiff of something foul and pungent in the air. Whatever is causing such an acrid stench must be nearby. But just then, another scent—!"

"著名的鬧鬼城市汪卡姆這一夜風雨交加，一片漆黑。你來到街上的時候，已經下起了傾盆大雨。但你聞到有大事將要發生，而對於事件，你的獠牙咬上了就不會鬆開。皮毛打濕少許也阻止不了你探尋真相。\n"
"汪卡姆一直有怪事發生。貓比以往都要多，而每天都有更多的鴿子消失。這種消息通常不會見報，但你知道這件事沒表面上那麼簡單。畢竟可愛又無害的貓咪只佔少數，而大多數都是些邪惡的陰謀家。你曾經聽到過低語聲，以及風中的呼號聲。弑鼠神教重臨狗鎮，只有你才能阻止它們的陰謀。\n"
"你前往口水區——汪卡姆靠近碼頭的街區，返回自己的家，這時你聞到空氣裡有一股臭味，難聞又刺鼻。附近一定有什麼東西引發了這股惡臭。但就在這時，你聞到了另一股氣味——！"

msgid "Follow the foul stench."
msgstr "循著這股難聞的惡臭。"

msgid "Follow the scent of bacon."
msgstr "循著培根的香味。"

msgid "No! You cannot be dissuaded, not even by thoughts of tasty bacon and ear scratches from all of the humans who congegrate around Velma’s Doghouse. This investigation is too important. You continue tracking the awful odor until you come upon its source: a hairball, hacked up in an alleyway by the docks. Of course. If this isn’t proof of feline involvement, you don’t know what is. Then you hear it: HRRK! HRRRRK! There’s only one thing that could be!"
msgstr "不！哪怕是你心裡放不下的美味培根，哪怕是維爾瑪犬舍圍著的人群擠傷了你的耳朵，也無法叫你停下。這次調查至關重要。你繼續追蹤，終於找到了這股惡臭的源頭：吐在碼頭旁邊一條小巷裡的一團毛球。顯而易見。這起事件鐵定與貓脫不了干係。隨後你聽見：呵啊！呵——啊！這就是那種生物的聲音！"

msgid "Confront the barfy cat."
msgstr "面對這隻狂吐的貓。"

msgid "Follow the cat to its lair."
msgstr "跟著這隻貓到它的老窩去。"

msgid "The investigation can wait. Bacon is eternal. You follow that lovely smell northeast to Velma’s Doghouse in Beasttown. The sounds of revelry and the sizzling of grilled food make your tail wag faster than the cracking of a whip. And yet, something else tugs at the back of your dog-brain… What was it you were doing before?"
msgstr "調查可以往後捎捎。培根永遠是第一位的。你循著這股誘人的香味往東北方向走去，前往野獸區的維爾瑪犬舍。狂歡的聲音與燒烤食物的滋滋聲，讓你的尾巴搖得比抽鞭子還快。然而，還有別的什麼東西在揪著你的狗腦子……你本來要幹什麼？"

msgid "Nope, food."
msgstr "不管了，管肚子要緊。"

msgid "Oh yeah, investigating the Order."
msgstr "噢對了，調查密會的事。"

"You are too dogged to turn back now. You soon come across the unfortunate creature, the source of the wretched retching. Once it is done, it goes back to licking its fur, and you wonder if cats truly have no sense of cause and effect. “What is the Order plotting?” you ask pointedly.\n"
"“Why should I tell you, mutt?” the cat replies with a hint of apathy in its voice. “You’ll be our prey soon enough.” With that, the cat leaps gracefully from the street to a low-hanging tree branch, and vanishes from sight.\n"
"Prey? You ponder the cat’s words. Conflict between your kind and theirs is as old as time, but you have never been their prey. What exactly is their game…?"
msgstr ""
"你脾性固執，不可能就此放棄。很快你就碰上了那個倒霉鬼，它正在惡心地嘔吐著。吐完之後，它又繼續舔著自己的毛髮，你懷疑貓壓根不懂凡事有因果的道理。“密會有什麼陰謀？”你尖銳地問道。\n"
"“我憑什麼告訴你，笨狗？”貓冷冷回道，“你們馬上就是我們的獵物了。”話音剛落，這貓便優雅地跳到一根低垂的樹枝上，消失在你的視線裡。\n"
"獵物？你仔細回想那隻貓所說的話。你們兩族之間早有衝突，但你們從來不會淪為它們的獵物。它們的計劃到底是什麼……？"

"You track the scent of the cat and follow from a distance. Eventually it leaves the docks and makes its way southwest, toward Snoutside. What could a cat be doing way out here?\n"
"Your question is answered when the creature is picked up by a robed human outside the manor house of the Barkham Hisstorical Society, an organization devoted to educating the populace about the “noble” cats of the city. It makes sense that such a reviled cult would be involved in this plot. The human brings the cat indoors, presumably to feed it and give it treats and such. Your blood boils. Curse you, foul cat! How dare you trick these humans into thinking you are cute and fluffy and not at all evil—!"

"你追蹤那隻貓的氣味，遠遠地跟著它。最後它離開了碼頭，往西南方向走去，前往鼻子區。貓怎麼會到這兒來？\n"
"你的問題很快就得到了答案，這隻貓在汪卡姆歷史協會大樓外被一名戴著兜帽的男子接走，而歷史協會致力於告訴平民，這座城市裡的貓咪有多麼“高貴”。這次陰謀中有此等臭名昭著的邪教組織摻和，一切都說得通了。這隻貓被人領進門去，大概是要餵它吃些食物什麼的。你熱血沸騰。該死的臭貓！你怎麼敢欺騙這些人類，讓他們以為你很可愛，毛茸茸的，一點也不邪惡——！"

": It isn’t until your belly is full of yummy food and your tummy has been thoroughly rubbed that you remember why you were out and about in the first place. You patrol the area until you spot several panicked rats scurrying from a nearby sewer drain.\n"
"“What’s the matter?” you bark. They chitter and chirp in response, and it is only then that you remember that rats can’t talk. Still, you glean some of their story from their frantic pantomiming. The Order of Dead Rodents at the Doorstep, as evidenced by their very namesake, has been hunting rats for ages. But now it is not just cats hunting them, but horrid cat-abominations that defy all earthly logic. Sounds like the Order is up to its old tricks once again…"

"你在肚子裡塞滿了美食，將鼓鼓的肚皮揉了個遍之後，才想起來你一開始為什麼跑出來。你在這個區域巡邏，發現幾隻驚慌失措的老鼠從附近的一條下水道裡竄出來。\n"
"“怎麼了？”你吠叫道。它們發出吱吱喳喳的聲音作為回應，這時你才想起來老鼠不會說話。儘管如此，你還是能從它們瘋狂比劃的手勢中得到一些信息。弒鼠神教正如其教名，多年以來都在獵殺老鼠。但現在獵殺它們的不單單是貓，還有違反現世邏輯的恐怖貓怪，看來弑鼠神教要故技重施了……"

"The urgency of your investigation is too important for you to be distracted by thoughts of tasty food. As you turn away from Velma’s, you spot a streak of cat-fur dipping gracefully out of sight. Using your keen sense of smell, you keep a tight pursuit as the cat winds its way west to Tailside, where Barkham’s train station can be found.\n"
"You follow the cat to the tracks on the western edge of town, where it ducks underneath an abandoned train car marked with a cat’s paw print. “Meowsachusetts Catnip Co.” reads the label beneath the logo. A front for a cult headquarters, no doubt. You are about to eavesdrop on the cats’ refuge when suddenly, a creature bursts forth from underneath the train! It is a hideous hybrid of bird, bat, and cat, with webbed paws and membranous wings notably lacking in fur, though its face is unmistakably feline. The sight of the thing makes your fur stand on end."

"你的當務之急就是要進行調查，美味的食物也無法令你分神。你從維爾瑪犬舍走開的時候，你發現貓毛形成的一抹曲線優雅地離開了你的視野。那隻貓蜿蜒向西，前往汪卡姆火車站所在的尾巴區，而你憑藉著敏銳的嗅覺緊緊跟隨。\n"
"你跟著貓來到城西邊緣的鐵軌，它就躲在一節印有貓爪印的廢舊車廂下面。貓爪印下面的標籤寫著“喵薩諸塞州貓薄荷公司”。無疑裡面就是邪教總部了。你正要偷聽這處貓咪庇護所裡面的聲音，突然一個生物從火車下面沖了出來！那是一種鳥、蝙蝠與貓的混血生物，形貌恐怖，帶蹼的爪子，膜狀的翅膀，身上明顯沒有毛髮，但又無疑長了一張貓臉。一見那傢伙你就嚇得毛髮倒豎。"
