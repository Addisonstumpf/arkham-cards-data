"Winlock fiddles with his mustache for a moment while he considers your words. As the leader of the expedition currently scouring through Dashur, the decision of whether or not to let you join the expedition is up to him. “Look, I read through the evidence you gathered. I know about what happened in Cairo. I believe your story. But, still…” He lets out an exasperated sigh. “I just don’t know how I’m going to convince the rest of the expedition crew. Ancient temples is one thing, but a gate to another dimension? This ‘Xzharah’ fellow? None of this can be real, right?”\n"
"Your research and your experience says otherwise. The threat is real. There is a secret organization operating within Egypt—The Brotherhood of the Beast—and if they are not stopped, their newfound “Chosen One” will begin a campaign of destruction that ends with the Earth.\n"
"You insist one last time to be allowed access to the expedition’s resources. “Alright, alright,” Winlock relents. “I don’t know what it is you’re looking for out there in the desert, but I hope you find it.” You shake your head in reply. You’d rather come up empty‑handed."

"溫洛克摩挲著自己的鬍子，思索著你的話。身為本次勘察代赫舒爾的領隊，你能不能加入探險隊完全取決於他。“瞧，你這些證據我都看了。我知道開羅發生了什麼。我也相信你說的。可是……”他惱火地嘆了一聲，“我只是不知道要怎麼說服探險隊的其它人。古代神廟是一回事，但要說通往另一個維度的入口？這個稱為伊扎法拉的傢伙？這些都不可能是真的，對吧？”\n"
"但你的研究和經驗得出的答案並不是這樣。威脅是確實存在的。這個神祕組織——惡獸兄弟會——在全埃及活動，要是不阻止他們，他們新發現的“天選”就會帶來毀滅，危害整個地球。\n"
"你又堅持了一次，一定要探險隊對你打開大門。“好吧，好吧。”溫洛克最終還是服軟了。“我不知道你到底要在沙漠裡找什麼，但我希望你能找到它。”你搖搖頭作為回應。那你情願空手而歸。"

"“It’s just an arch. Why’re you so worked up, boss?” Winlock crossed his arms. Something about all of this felt wrong. He was sure that this was the place those folks from Arkham were looking for—a delicately patterned archway that led nowhere at all—and yet, Winlock was certain there was something <i>on the other side</i>. “It’s not Egyptian,” he noted, staring at the thing with narrow eyes. “It doesn’t even look…human.”\n"
"“You believed those loons? Look boss, it’s nothing!” one of his men laughed.\n"
"“Is it?” Winlock snapped, eyes wide. “Is it?”"

"“這就是個拱門。你幹嘛這麼激動，老大？”溫洛克叉著手。這東西渾身上下都透著一股不對勁。他確信這地方就是那群阿卡姆來的人要找的地方——繪有精妙圖文的拱門——很明顯不通往任何地方——但是，溫洛克確定在另一端一定有著什麼。“這不是埃及的東西。”他眯起眼凝視著拱門，“這看起來甚至都不是……不是人類的東西。”\n"
"“你相信那些傻瓜？看啊老大，<b>這什麼都不是！</b>”其中一個隊員笑道。\n"
"“嗯？”溫洛克瞪大了眼睛厲聲說道，“是嗎？”"

msgid "The essence fades from Xzharah’s body. Swirling clouds of mist surround him and force him to his knees. Creatures of the abyss appear wordlessly at your side, surrounding Xzharah with a quiet, expressionless hate. Xzharah’s sword betrays him and falls from his grip, the blade fracturing as it clatters to the ground. “…The prophecy must be fulfilled…” It is the last of his vile whispers. His physical form vanishes into the realm’s ethereal mist, and all is silent in the Great Abyss."
msgstr "伊扎法拉的實體開始消散。團團雲霧環繞著他，迫使他跪下。深淵的生物無聲無息地出現在你周圍，帶著寂靜而面無表情的恨意包圍住了伊扎法拉。就連伊扎法拉的劍都不聽他的使喚，掉在了地上，劍刀碎裂開來。“預言必須被實現……”這是伊扎法拉邪惡聲音留下的最後一句。他的實體消散在這片領域的薄霧中。大深淵裡只留一片寂靜。"

msgid "Xzharah places an ice-cold hand on your shoulder as you kneel before him. “You have proven your loyalty,” he decrees. Creatures of the abyss surround you, heads bowed in reverence to their new master. There are none left to oppose him. “Few of your kind have the wit or the will to see beyond the present. To see our prophecy fulfilled. But you are worthy enough to have your eyes opened. Far worthier than the fools I have trusted in the past.” He bids you to stand, and places the handle of his blood-soaked sword in your hands. “Now arise, Servant of the Beast, and take your place among us.”"
msgstr "你跪在伊扎法拉面前，他將冰冷的手放在你肩上。“你已經證明了自己的忠誠。”他宣佈道。深淵中的生物環繞著你，低頭向新主人致意。再也沒有誰敢反抗他了。“你的族裔中很少有人能具備足夠的智慧或意志能看到未來。看到我們的預言實現。但你很有價值，打開了自己的眼界。比我過去信任的蠢貨都更有價值。”他讓你站起身，將自己那把染血彎劍的劍柄交到了你的手裡，“現在起身吧，惡獸之僕。你在我們之中赢得了一席之地。”"
