"You send a missive to Agent Flint ahead of your arrival, setting a meeting place and time—Jing’an Temple at noon. —and head there as soon as you arrive, entering the broad stone courtyard at the temple’s entrance. After a short while, a tourist approaches you and asks in English: “You’re sure you’re alone?” It takes you a moment to realize that the tourist is none other than Flint, in a subtle yet convincing disguise. He narrows his eyes at your stare. “Answer me,” he says, scanning his surroundings.\n"
"You assure him that you haven’t been followed. “Can’t be too careful. Eyes everywhere. I have a lead on one of those Coterie types here in Shanghai, just like the Foundation’s intel suggested. They call her ‘subject #46–Q,’ aka ‘Lady with Red Parasol.’ Sure enough, she brings that parasol everywhere she goes. As far as Coterie insignias go, it’s not the most subtle.” While he whispers, he pulls a large camera and tripod from his duffel bag and painstakingly sets up a shot of the temple.\n"
"You wonder aloud what in the world Flint is up to. “Stop staring,” he hisses under his breath. Then you spot other tourists taking photos as well, and you realize that Flint is better at blending in than you are. “The last time I saw the lady with the parasol, she was leaving a meeting between several wealthy British and Chinese businessmen—railway men,” he says quietly, head still down. “Women aren’t usually allowed at such meetings. Nor are regular citizens. To be in that room, you have to be able to get the attention of those powerful men. Which means you’re either very powerful, or obscenely wealthy.” Flint takes a few photos, then moves to a new spot and starts the tedious process of focusing the camera all over again. “Within two weeks of that meeting, they announced a lucrative new contract. It seems all their competitors were convinced for one reason or another to step away from the project, which left them to write their own ticket. Name their own price.” He slowly scans the courtyard again, careful to move just his eyes and not his head. “Could be she has leverage on them. Or maybe she’s just that charming. But I’m willing to put my money on it being the influence of a Key. If that’s true, it’s imperative that we’re not made.” Flint’s paranoia is infectious."

"你在抵達前送了一則訊息給弗林特，約他中午在靜安寺見面。你一抵達就直接前往那裡。你在寺廟前的石板廣場等待了一陣子，突然一名遊客靠近用英文問你：“你確定沒有被跟蹤嗎？”片刻後你才反應過來他就是弗林特，他做了一點偽裝。他瞇起眼對上你的視線說：“回答我。”一邊掃視周圍。\n"
"你向他保證沒人跟蹤你。“小心為上，到處都有眼線。我照著基石的情報在上海追查到一個結社成員。他們稱她為‘目標#46-Q’或‘紅傘女子’，她的陽傘從不離身，也許是結社的身份象徵吧，她並沒有要隱藏的意思。”他邊低語著，邊從旅行包中拿出相機與腳架，艱難的架起相機對著寺廟。\n"
"你對弗林特的行為感到不解。“不要一直盯著看。”弗林特噓了你一聲。你發現有很多其他觀光客也在照相，才發覺弗林特比你更認真在融入環境。“我最近一次看到那個女人是在一場會議結束時，她跟幾個英國和中國的鐵路大亨一起走出來。”他低著頭安靜的說，“那種會議通常都不讓女人參與，也不會有一般民眾。要參加那場會議，必須入得了那些大亨的眼，換句話說，你得要很有權力，不然就得很有錢。”弗林特照了幾張相後移動到另一個地點，重複麻煩的架設過程。“會議兩週後，他們公開了一份收益豐厚的合約。看來因為所有競爭者都被說服讓步，所以他們可以自己制定規則跟價格。”他再次掃視廣場，但小心地不轉頭，只動眼睛。“她一定對他們動了什麼手腳，也可能是她真的有足夠的魅力。但我敢打賭一定是密鑰的影響，如果真是這樣，我們要極度小心不要被控制。”你也開始被弗林特的疑神疑鬼感染了。"

msgid "Look, I would tell you more, maybe even let you help me out here, but you’ve made it pretty clear you’re a bit chatty, and the last thing I need is the Coterie figuring out I’m on to them. So, how about we split up? Keep doing what you’re doing, and I’ll contact you when I have a good lead.” Without letting you protest, Flint packs up his camera and leaves."
msgstr "“聽著，我會告訴你更多資訊，甚至可以讓你幫我。但你已經證明自己不善於保密，而我不想讓結社知道我在追查他們。所以，我們還是分開行動吧，你繼續你的工作，當我查到有力線索後會聯絡你。”你還來不及反對他就帶著相機離開了。"

msgstr "如果剩餘的時間少於6，則改為將“ψ”標記在“經過的時間”的最終格子中。"

msgid "“It will take some time to learn more about her and find the right opportunity to apprehend her,” Flint says quietly. “I saw how you acted with Taylor. I trust you to be discreet. So, I’ll contact you when I have a good lead. Or, I suppose you could stay and aid my investigation here.”"
msgstr "“要取得更多情報跟找到好時機跟她接觸會需要一點時間。”弗林特靜靜的說，“你在泰勒面前的表現讓我相信你是能夠保密的。所以，當我查到有力線索後會聯絡你；或是你可以幫我一起進行調查。”"

msgid "“Happy hunting, then,” Flint says with a nod. He hands you a slip of paper with his hotel, room number, and alias scribbled down on it. “In case you need to get in touch. I’ll send you a telegram when I know more. At least your travel expenses are on government dime, right?”"
msgstr "弗林特點頭說：“狩獵愉快。”他遞給你一張寫著他的飯店、房間號碼跟假名的紙條。“以防你需要聯絡我。我有更多消息後會發電報給你。至少你的旅費可以報帳對吧？”"

msgid "Over the course of several weeks, you manage to strike up a relationship with some of your quarry’s business associates—titans of industry in the fields of mining and railroad construction. You bide your time, earning a bit of their confidence, and it isn’t long before they mention the lady with the red parasol, whom they call Tzu San Niang. Her silver tongue and negotiating skills are apparently the thing of legend. One remarks, with a dreadful laugh, of her ability to convince worker unions to tolerate abysmal conditions, and local governments to accept the extraction of natural resources without batting an eye. Under the guise of needing her help for a project, you inquire about how to contact her. Your contacts inform you that she’s just landed a deal in Hong Kong and is already on her way there."
msgstr "經過幾週的調查，你終於跟幾個你獵物的關係人建立了聯繫，他們都是鐵路或礦業的大亨。你花了點時間贏得他們的信任，不久他們就提到了拿紅陽傘的女子，他們叫她梓三娘。她的巧舌如簧跟精湛的談判技巧堪稱傳奇。其中一個人邊奸笑著邊回憶起她說服工會接受苛刻的條件，還有政府機關連眼睛都沒眨一下，就接受了無節制開發自然資源的計畫。你以自己的項目需要她幫忙做為偽裝，詢問要如何與她連絡。你的聯絡人告訴你她在香港有一個案子要談，她已經動身出發了。"

msgstr "在劇本日誌中的東南亞部分，找出香港。在該空格上標記“50−S”，每當你啟程時可以旅行到香港了。"

msgid "Flint gives you a frustrated look. “Really? After all this work?” You explain to him that if the lady with the red parasol is as elusive and dangerous as she seems, it might be more prudent to work on other, more pressing cases. “I suppose you might have a point. Seems like a waste, though. I’ll make sure to report in with the Commissioner so she’s aware of what’s going on here, though. Maybe they can send somebody else to…” he trails off, then shakes his head. “Nah. They’d just muck it up.”"
msgstr "弗林特看起來很挫折。“真的嗎？在努力這麼久之後？”你跟他解釋如果紅傘女子跟看起來一樣危險而難對付，那也許把精力放在其他更急迫的目標上會比較好。“我想你是對的，雖然感覺很可惜。我會向調查官報告這裡的事情，也許他們會派其他人來……”他停頓了一下，然後搖了搖頭。“算了。他們只會搞得更糟。”"

msgid "In your Campaign Log, record <i>Flint abandoned his search</i>. Any one investigator may choose to add the Inspector Flint story asset to their deck. It does not count toward their deck size. This card can be found in the <i>Globetrotting</i> encounter set."
