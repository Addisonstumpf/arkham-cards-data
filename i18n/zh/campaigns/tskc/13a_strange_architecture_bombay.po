msgid "The air is deliciously warm as you wait for a tram in southern Bombay. With several days until the next leg of your journey, you allow yourself to be drawn in by the city’s intoxicating color and light. A whirlwind first day sees you visit various temples, curio shops, and bazaars. Bright orange flowers hang by strings from bamboo racks as you make your way through a bazaar toward the Colaba Causeway, where the Gateway of India looks out onto the waterfront. As the day turns to evening, you continue to explore back alleys and side streets lit by delicately inlaid bronze lamps. The air is thick with unknown scents and hazy shapes as you lose yourself in the heady atmosphere of the old city. As you make your way to your hotel, you cross a wide thoroughfare into the Kala Ghoda district and stroll down its old, winding roads."
msgstr "你正在孟買南部等待著電車，宜人的氣溫讓你全身舒暢。離你啟程的時間還有幾天，你允許自己暫時沉醉在這座城市迷人的色彩跟光線中。抵達的第一天你如旋風般拜訪了許多不同的寺廟、古玩店跟市集。你走在銅鑼灣商業街上，亮橘色的花朵擺滿路邊竹製的架子，在大街的盡頭，著名的印度門瞭望著水面。天色漸漸轉暗，你走入小路及巷弄中，青銅鑲嵌的燈盞在路上投下精緻的光影。不熟悉的芬芳與朦朧的光影讓你陶醉在這座古老城市的氛圍中。在你返回旅館的路上，你走過卡拉哥達區的大道，轉入一條古老的小路，風突然吹起。"

msgid "As you navigate the labyrinthine art district, you pass a familiar sight. Looking up, you see a narrow building with a slate façade, wide black windows, and unsettling accents. You have the distinct feeling you have been here before. You stand still for a moment as others pass you in the narrow street until you remember the same building in Stockholm. If not for the distinct, black windows and the harsh lines, you might not have remembered it. As you scan the façade, the frieze overhanging the door stands out to you. Where there were various recognizable figures before, you see odd, gangling facsimiles. The features are almost plastic; the smiles are too broad; the eyes seem to bulge. The number 13 is carved next to the door, same as in Stockholm. Curious, you step up and turn the doorknob, but it doesn’t budge. Knocking on the door produces virtually no sound. Although it looks like wood, it feels solid as concrete. Stopping a passer-by, you ask how long the building has been here. “This is an ancient place. These buildings have been here a long time,” they tell you. You find yourself questioning if the original you saw was even the original: how many other houses look just like this one in how many other cities? The building grows more foreboding the longer you look at it. A shudder courses up your spine, and you decide to leave the building alone."
msgstr "你穿越迷宮般的小路時，抬頭看見一棟狹窄的建物，門上有石板裝飾，窗戶一片漆黑，散發著令人不安的氣息。你之前有過這種奇怪的感覺，你佇立了一陣子後才回想起斯德哥爾摩的那棟建築。如果不是看見漆黑的窗戶跟獨特的銳利線條，你可能無法回想起來。你檢視著建築，門上的石板吸引了你的注意力，你認出幾個跟另一個建築不同的符號，你看見奇怪、高瘦的人形，但樣子非常不自然；嘴咧的太寬、眼睛也過於突出。門上的號碼與斯德哥爾摩相同，都是13。你好奇地上前轉動門把，但它紋絲不動。你試著敲門，卻幾乎沒發出聲音，雖然門的材質看起來像木頭，摸起來卻像水泥一般堅硬。你詢問路人這座建築是什麼時候建成的。他們只是說：“這是個古老的地方，它已經在這裡很多年了。”你疑惑著之前看到的那座建築是否是原版的，又有多少城市中有類似的建築？你看著建築越久，不祥的感覺就越強，你打了個冷顫後離開了，決定不要跟它有更多牽扯。"

msgid "As you navigate the labyrinthine art district, one façade in particular stands out to you. A narrow building with handsome cornice molding and intricate stonework is wedged between two older local buildings. The number 13 is carved next to a pair of austere wooden doors. Over the door is a slate frieze that depicts a cast of mythological figures: some recognizable, some not. The building itself looks out of place amidst the intricate architecture of the surrounding area. The look of the building makes you feel vaguely uneasy the longer you study it. There is a coldness, a sharpness to the building’s design, accentuated by jagged quoins and harsh angles. Something about the wide, black windows, the dark interior, denotes the emptiness of a hollow skull. The darkness in the evening only magnifies the sense of eeriness; others do not seem so willing to linger here."
msgstr "你穿越迷宮般的小路時，一棟狹窄的建物吸引了你的注意力。它的屋簷上有精美的裝飾，還有精湛的石雕工藝，讓它與兩邊老舊的建築顯得截然不同。簡樸的木製大門上刻著數字13，門上方有一塊石板，上面刻著各種神話中的符號與形狀，有些你認識；有些無法辨認。這座建築在周圍建築環繞下顯得格格不入。不適的感覺在你檢視建築時逐漸增長，建築本身的設計有種冷酷、尖銳的感覺，銳利的牆角跟線條更加強了這種印象。漆黑的大面窗戶跟其中的黑暗就像骷髏的雙眼一般空洞而詭異。夜晚昏暗的光線更增添了它不詳的氣息，街上的路人似乎都不想在此多逗留。"
