"After some searching, you find Dr. Irawan in the Belmond Copacabana seated at a table covered in sketches and academic clutter. “I am actually glad you missed my lecture,” she says. “It was an utter disaster. I was laughed out of the auditorium when I tried to present. Someone called me a ‘cryptozoologist’.”\n"
"Dr. Irawan adjusts her large round spectacles as she turns to a beautifully detailed sketch of a bird roosting in a palm tree. “I presented what I am calling the Theory of Annihilation. A process by which an ecosystem is, itself, devoured via what you have dubbed ‘paranatural selection.’ Not just the ecosystem, but the memory of itself. The fact of its very existence.”\n"
"“Do not worry, I will credit you for that term,” she takes a sip of strong, dark coffee. “But after my recent survey of the Amazon, I am afraid the process is accelerating. A dozen species of macaw have vanished, and my colleagues have no memory of them. The sketches have disappeared as well. Of those we documented, only the scarlet macaw remains.”\n"
"As Dr. Irawan flips idly through her sketchbook, her eyes catch on a particular page, and her face goes white. “This cannot be.”\n"
"You ask her what the matter is, and she points to the page. “Just yesterday, this page was not blank. The <i>Phalanger septimus</i>. A cuscus living in the western New Guinea.”\n"
"Dr. Irawan begins gathering up her things. “I sketched this subject months ago. Perhaps there will be some trace of it—or of whatever force is behind all this—out in Manokwari.” She pushes a strand of hair behind her ear and smiles at you. “Thank you for listening. Perhaps we will meet again.”"

"在做了一些調查後，你在貝爾蒙德科帕卡巴納飯店找到了伊拉萬博士，她坐在一張散落著筆記、草稿跟其他學術用品的桌子後。“我很慶幸你錯過了我的講座，那真是天大的災難。我發表的東西遭到所有人的嘲笑，有些人甚至叫我‘獨角獸學家’。”\n"
"伊拉萬博士推了推她的圓框眼鏡，指向一張精美的素描，上面畫著一隻鳥棲息在棕櫚樹上。“我發表了一個我稱為湮滅理論的假設。生態系會被你所謂的‘悖常天擇’吞噬，不只是生態系本身，而是記憶都一起被吞噬，抹除一切存在的證據。”\n"
"“別擔心，我會標記那個詞的出處的。”她喝了一口苦澀的黑咖啡。“恐怕這個狀況在我從亞馬遜調查回來後正在加速發生。十幾種金剛鸚鵡已經消失了，而我的同事們對牠們毫無記憶，素描也都消失了。在我們記錄到的種類中，只有緋紅金剛鸚鵡還存在。”\n"
"伊拉萬博士隨意的翻著她的素描本，但在翻到某一頁時，她的臉色瞬間變白。“這不可能啊。”\n"
"你問發生了什麼事，她指著那頁說：“它昨天還不是空白的，賽提米烏斯貂，一種生活在新幾內亞西部的袋貂。”\n"
"伊拉萬博士開始收拾東西。“我幾個月前才畫下這份素描。也許在曼洛瓦里會有造成這一切元凶的線索。”她將一絲頭髮撥到耳後對你說：“感謝你的聆聽，也許我們會再見面。”"

"After some searching, you find Dr. Irawan in the Belmond Copacabana seated at a table covered in sketches and academic clutter. After introducing yourself, you ask about her research.\n"
"“Oh, I see. You are here to mock me,” she says, closing a worn survey journal. You tell her you aren’t, and after some coaxing, she opens up to you. “I am actually glad you missed my lecture,” she says. “It was an utter disaster. I was laughed out of the auditorium when I tried to present. Someone called me a ‘cryptozoologist’.”\n"
"You tell her that there are worse insults. “That may be,” Dr. Irawan adjusts her large round spectacles. “But for my career, it is a death knell.” She turns to a beautifully detailed sketch of a bird roosting in a palm tree. “I presented what I am calling the Theory of Annihilation. The world devouring itself. Not just itself, but the memory of itself. The fact of its very existence.”\n"
"She takes a sip of strong, dark coffee. “Several years ago, I surveyed the Amazon with a half dozen other well-known academics. We observed dozens of distinct species of macaw, and named each after a stone: turquoise, amethyst, obsidian, the like. But now,” she turns to several empty pages. “There is no trace or record of any of them. My colleagues tell me I made up the Turquoise Macaw and the others. There is no trace of them in their habitat, either. And the sketches have disappeared as well.”\n"
"You assure Dr. Irawan that she is not mad, and share what little you can about the disappearances.\n"
"“Thank you,” says Dr. Irawan. “I am glad we met. I was beginning to think this was all in my head.” She gives you her business card with the address of a university in Australia written on the back. “I will be in Perth to continue my survey and my next lecture. Perhaps I will see you there.”"

"在做了一些調查後，你在貝爾蒙德科帕卡巴納飯店找到了伊拉萬博士，她坐在一張散落著筆記、草稿跟其他學術用品的桌子後。你自我介紹後，詢問她正在進行的研究。\n"
"“喔，我懂了，你也是來嘲笑我的。”她重重闔上磨損嚴重的旅行筆記。你告訴她不是這樣，經過一陣安撫後，她終於願意開口。“我很慶幸你錯過了我的講座，那真是天大的災難。我發表的東西遭到所有人的嘲笑，有些人甚至叫我‘獨角獸學家’。”\n"
"你安慰她說你聽過很多更糟糕的詞。“可能吧。”伊拉萬博士推了推她的圓框眼鏡。“但在我的領域裡，這跟宣判死刑沒兩樣。”她指向一張精美的素描，上面畫著一隻鳥棲息在棕櫚樹上。“我發表了一個我稱為湮滅理論的假設。世界會自我吞噬，不只是本身，而是連記憶都一起被吞噬，抹除一切存在的證據。”\n"
"她喝了一口苦澀的黑咖啡。“幾年前，我跟六個知名的學者一起前往亞馬遜進行調查。我們觀察到數種獨特的金剛鸚鵡，我們用礦物為牠們命名：綠松石、紫水晶、黑曜岩之類的。但現在，”她翻到幾頁空白頁，“相關的記錄都不見了，我的同事說牠們都是我捏造出來的。在牠們原本的棲息地也不見牠們的蹤影，素描也全都消失了。”\n"
"你向伊拉萬博士保證她沒有瘋，並分享了一些你對於消失事件的所見所聞。\n"
"“謝謝你。”伊拉萬博士說。“很高興認識你，我差點開始以為這一切都是幻覺了。”她給了你一張名片，背後是一間澳洲大學的地址。“我會在伯斯繼續研究跟準備下一次發表，也許你可以到那跟我碰面。”"
