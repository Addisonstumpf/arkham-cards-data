"The dark stifles. It moves like a living creature, constricts the air as if you were inside a shapeless cocoon. A figment of your anxious and overactive imagination, you hope. But everything about this meeting puts your nerves on edge. You almost didn’t accept the mysterious invitation, but recent events have forced your hand. It’s been several months since the disappearances began, and all of your leads in Arkham have dried up.\n"
"It started in the winter of 1924 with several vehicles in Southside: two Studebakers, a Cadillac, and a Rolls Royce, all of them top-of-the-line. One moment they were there, the next… nothing, save for a single deflated wheel. The police believed it to be the work of bootleggers looking for more vehicles to add to their routes, but the cars were too nice, would draw too much attention. Perhaps they were taken down to Boston or New York and flipped for a pretty penny, and that’s just what you figured happened… until the disappearances continued.\n"
"Next to go was a streetlamp outside the Ward Theatre in Downtown. Then, two pets—a dog and a cat, whisked away almost simultaneously right out from under their owners’ noses, not two doors down from one another. You learned the news when you saw the missing posters plastered all over College Street. On a whim, you interviewed the owners. No sign of foul play, and it was unlikely for them to have run away. Something stank about all of it.\n"
"Then people started to disappear. A child from Easttown. A student in Miskatonic University. The chief of Arkham’s fire department. And as the police closed each case with no clues or suspects, a curious thing began to happen. One by one, as time marched on, the things that went missing vanished not only from Arkham, but from memory. The owners of those vehicles suddenly claimed to have never owned them. The pets, the people, all of them were wiped from the memories of every single person in town.\n"
"Everyone but you. You, and you alone, remembered.\n"
"Perhaps it was simply the way of things. Humans are fickle and forgetful by nature. But it couldn’t be so simple. It was just too…strange. Coincidental.\n"
"That’s when the letter arrived.\n"
"<typewriter>\tGreetings,</typewriter>\n"
"<typewriter>\tI hope this letter finds you well. You do not know me, but I know you. I cannot tell you much through paper correspondence, as it may be intercepted. Suffice it to say that I know of the matters you are looking into, and I also know that you believe yourself to be alone in your investigation. The truth is that you are not alone. Such events are not unique to your city of Arkham. What you have observed is happening in major cities all over the world. I am one of those, like you, who seeks the truth. Who remembers.</typewriter>\n"
"<typewriter>\tThere is another related matter which I must bring to your attention. I need your help, and you need mine. Enclosed is a ticket to a show at the Riverview Theater. If you wish to know more, please meet me there and we can speak further. Come alone.</typewriter>\n"
"<typewriter>\tIn truth,</typewriter>\n"
"<fancy>\t\tLi Flint</fancy>\n"
"The ticket in the envelope was indeed for a private showing at Arkham’s new movie palace in Downtown. With no other leads and no good reason to avoid going, you have decided to accept the mysterious invitation…"

"黑暗令人窒息。就像一個活物正逐漸將空氣收緊，想將你困於無形的繭內。你希望這只是焦慮引起的過度想像。但這次會面讓你的所有神經都高度警戒。你差點拒絕了這個神秘的邀請，但最近的事件讓你別無選擇。失蹤事件已經持續了好幾個月，而你在阿卡姆的線索已經全部斷絕。\n"
"這一切是從1924年的冬天開始的，有幾輛車在南區離奇消失，兩輛斯圖貝克、一輛凱迪拉克跟一輛勞斯萊斯，全是最頂級的車款，現場只剩下一個漏氣的輪胎。警方認為是走私販們的手筆，但這些車太高級了，會引來不必要的注意。它們也許被運往波士頓或紐約銷贓了，你正這樣覺得時……更多消失事件持續發生。\n"
"接著消失的是在商業區沃德戲院外的路燈。然後兩隻寵物——一隻狗跟一隻貓，在不同的地點幾乎同時從主人面前跑走，你從貼在大學街上的傳單上得知這件事。出於一時的奇想，你訪談了兩位飼主，看起來不像惡作劇，你也看不出寵物們有什麼逃離他們的理由。這一切感覺有奇特的關聯。\n"
"接著人們也開始失蹤。東城區的一個小孩、米斯卡塔尼克大學的一名學生、阿卡姆消防局的隊長。而就在警方由於找不到線索與嫌疑犯只好結束調查後，奇怪的事發生了。一個接一個，隨著時間過去，消失的人事物也在人們的記憶中消失了。那些車輛的主人宣稱他們從來沒買過這些車，寵物、活人，所有關於他們的記憶都被從每個人的記憶中抹除了。\n"
"每個人，除了你以外，只有你一人還記得。\n"
"也許這是自然現象，人們一向善變又健忘。但事情不可能這麼簡單，這一切都太……奇怪了，也太巧合了。\n"
"就在此時，你收到了一封信。\n"
"<typewriter>你好，</typewriter>\n"
"<typewriter>我希望這封信安全送達你手中。你不認識我，但我認識你。我不能在信中說太多，它可能會被攔截。簡單來說我知道你正在調查的事，我也知道你認為自己是唯一一個，但事實上你不是。類似的事件不只在阿卡姆發生，你現在面臨的事件也正在全世界各個主要城市發生。我是其中一員，跟你一樣，找尋真相的人、未遺忘的人。</typewriter>\n"
"<typewriter>我有另一件與此相關的事必須告訴你。我需要你的幫助，如同你需要我的一樣。信中附上的是河景戲院的票。如果你想知道更多，請到那裡跟我見面，讓我們深入交談。請獨自前來。</typewriter>\n"
"<typewriter>真摯的，</typewriter>\n"
"<fancy>李·弗林特</fancy>\n"
"信封中附上一張私人表演的票，地點是阿卡姆商業區新開幕的電影院。你已經失去所有線索，也沒有更好的選擇，你決定接受這個神秘的邀約。"

"Flint produces a file fat with documentation and slides it between the two seat cushions in front of you. Inside is a wealth of information regarding cases similar to the ones you have been investigating. Photos of vehicles, factory machines, and public figures, all missing. All forgotten. And just as Flint’s letter promised, the file includes reports from all over the world. London. Shanghai. Bruges. Rio de Janeiro. Cairo. The list goes on and on. “There’s more,” he says after giving you time to read. “Flip to the end.”\n"
"You do, and what greets you there are two photographs clipped together. The first is of a street in London, distorted by some sort of interference. A light shines above the street corner, and around it, the picture appears to be pinched, like a miniature vortex is pulling reality toward it. The other is a photograph of a man on the other side of that same street corner, ducking into the shadows. He wears a tailored grey suit and a wide-brimmed hat that obscures his face. The only discernible detail you can make out from the photo is the man’s distinctive red gloves. Rare as it is for a photograph to have color, you wonder if the long exposure time is what led to the strange blurring effect. “This was taken by my partner several days ago. Just before he, too, vanished. Whatever is going on, you can be sure that man with the red gloves is somehow involved.”\n"
"Getting to the point, you ask Inspector Flint what exactly he wants from you. “To work together. Share what we know. Sparingly few seem to know the truth.” You agree. If what the man says is true, and events like this are happening all over the world, getting to the bottom of it will require more than just you. “To that end, I would ask that you come to London with me. That man with the red gloves has been sighted in the area, and he’s not alone. I would bet good money that he knows something about where my partner is. Arrangements have already been made. There are steamship tickets in that file. The ship departs from Boston in two days.”"

"弗林特從座椅中的空隙遞給你一份厚重的資料夾。裡面是與你調查內容相似的資料。車輛的照片、工廠裡的機器，還有各種公共設施，都消失並被遺忘了。而就如弗林特說的，裡面還有世界上其他城市的資料。倫敦、上海、布魯日、里約熱內盧、開羅，還有更多其他城市。你翻閱了一陣子後弗林特開口說道：“還不只這些，翻到最後一頁。”\n"
"你照做，在末頁看到兩張被釘在一起的照片。第一張是倫敦某條街道，但被某種力量模糊了。一道光打在街角，它周圍的景物看起來被扭曲了，就像是有一個小漩渦正在將周圍的東西吸進去。另一張照片是在街角的另一端，有個男人隱沒在陰影中，他穿著合身的灰色西裝，戴著一頂遮住臉的寬邊帽。唯一一個可辨識的東西是他的紅色手套。有顏色的照片非常少見，你同時也在懷疑是不是曝光時間過長導致了模糊的效果。“這是幾天前我的搭檔拍攝的，就在他消失之前。無論到底發生什麼事，一定都跟那個紅手套的男人有關。”\n"
"你切入重點，直接詢問弗林特警探希望你做什麼。“一起行動、分享情報，共同發掘真相。”你同意了，如果他說的是真的，全世界都在發生類似的事件，那單憑你是無法查出真相的。”所以我必須邀請你跟我一起前往倫敦。紅手套的男人在那裡被目擊，而且他不是單獨行動。我敢打賭他知道我的搭檔在哪裡。我已經安排好了，檔案夾裡有張船票，兩天後在波士頓出發。”"

"你詢問紅手套這代表的意思。“他——需要再次——效力。“他沙啞的說。你打開棺蓋，裡面躺著一句古老的屍體，看起來有幾百年的歷史了。紅寶石眼睛正反射著微弱的燭光，直直盯著你。“這是——禮物。“紅手套的聲音從背後傳來。你把頭撇開，試著在不看這噁心畫面的狀況下將紅寶石從眼眶中拔出來。你轉身想詢問這個物品是什麼，卻發現他已經消失了，就像那些消失的人們一樣。但沒有痕跡，沒有黏液物質，也沒有離開的足跡。他就這樣消失了。\n"
"你還沒來的及思考其中的含意，上方就傳來密門打開的聲響，伴隨著踏在樓梯上的沉重腳步聲。你拿起武器準備戰鬥，但接著你驚訝的看見來人是弗林特警探。他被一名穿著黑色西裝，頭戴寬邊帽的女性用槍指著，她有檀木般深色的皮膚，冷酷的眼睛下方有很深的眼袋，以及修短的捲髮。另外還有兩名身著西裝的人伴隨她進入墓穴，他們像雕像一般佇立，一言不發。她迅速展示了一枚你認不得的銀色徽章，並示意你不要輕舉妄動。她開口問：“那名戴著紅手套的人去哪裡了？你到底是誰？”\n"
"“現在我可以把手放下了嗎？”弗林特警探問。"

"You search for the man with the red gloves through every possible hiding place and down every shadowed corridor, but he is well and truly gone. It is as if he vanished into thin air. You wonder for a moment if he was somehow erased from existence like the other disappearances, but you don’t believe so. There is no mark. No ectoplasmic remains. He simply was there, and then he was not.\n"
"You give up searching for him and instead examine the crypt that the man was rummaging through. Inside is an old and forgotten corpse, likely hundreds of years old. You don’t have the object here to do a perfect size comparison, but you are quite sure that the ruby marble the red-gloved man stole before disappearing would have fit inside one of the corpse’s eyesockets. Indeed, examining the corpse, you see that one such socket is covered in webs and sickly with rot, while the other remains strangely smooth on the inside. Whatever that marble is, it must have been what the man with the red gloves sought all along… but why?\n"
"Investigating further, you find neither name nor epitaph identifying the corpse buried here, only the following lines of what appears to be poetry chiseled into the lid of the body’s coffin:\n"
"<center>With red we are bound.</center>\n"
"<center>Through red we are one.</center>\n"
"<center>Thus in red do we bury our kin and our ken.</center>\n"
"<center>May you rest, until you are needed once more.</center>\n"
"Before you have time to even consider what this might mean, you hear the telltale rumbling of the secret passageway shifting upstairs once more, and the pounding of heavy footsteps down the stairwell. You arm yourself and prepare for a fight. To your surprise, it is Inspector Flint who greets you, held at gunpoint by a woman dressed in a black suit, wide-brimmed hat, and matching black trousers. She has ebony-dark skin, cold eyes underscored by heavy bags, and short, curly hair. Two other suits flank her, both of whom say nothing and stand like statues as she enters the crypt. She flashes an unidentifiable silver badge and motions for you to stay put. “Where did the man with the red gloves go?” she asks. “And who exactly are you?”\n"
"“Can I put my hands down now?” Inspector Flint says."

"你搜尋了每個可能的躲藏處跟每條黑暗的長廊，但紅手套確實已經離開了，就像消失在空氣中一樣。雖然有瞬間你懷疑他是不是像其他人一樣被抹除了，但你不這樣認為。沒有痕跡，也沒有黏液般的物質。他純粹就是消失了。\n"
"你放棄搜尋他，轉向檢視紅手套翻找的墓穴，裡面是具年代久遠的遺骸，看來已經下葬數百年了。雖然沒有東西可以比對，但你很確定紅手套偷走的那顆紅寶石珠原先一定是鑲在死者的眼眶中。因為一邊的眼眶已經腐爛並被蛛網覆蓋，而另一邊則很詭異的非常乾淨而光滑。不管那個珠子是什麼，它一定就紅手套在找的東西但……原因是什麼呢？\n"
"仔細調查後，你還是找不到這名死者的姓名與身分，只發現一段刻在棺蓋上的短詩：\n"
"<center>我們因緋紅結契。</center>\n"
"<center>我們因緋紅為一。</center>\n"
"<center>手足智識皆深埋緋紅之中。</center>\n"
"<center>安息吧，直至你再度獻身。</center>\n"

"You wait impatiently for Inspector Flint to arrive, your nerves on edge. Something must have happened to him. But you still remember him—that’s good. You tap your foot nervously as you strain to recall his face, the sound of his voice, the events that led you here. Tap tap tap. Perhaps you should be out there looking for him. What if he is in trouble? Tap tap tap. Maybe he is already gone. Perhaps only you remember him. And what of the man with the red gloves? Tap tap tap. You wait. And wait. And wait.\n"
"You barely notice the chair across from you sliding out until Flint takes his seat. To your relief, he is unharmed, although you suspect he has not slept in some time. Lines of worry are creased along his forehead, and his eyes are bloodshot and wide with fear. Yours feel the same.\n"
"Breaking the tense air with a joke, you inform Inspector Flint that he is late. He chuckles and nods. “Apologies. Another detective with the ICPC is… missing,” he explains, exhaustion and anxiety giving his voice a bitter edge. “Please tell me you have something for me.”\n"
"You sigh and give your report. Flint cradles his fingers and rubs them idly as you explain what you have learned. “This proves that the man with the red gloves is not working alone,” he says.\n"
"Just then, a woman’s voice interrupts from across the room. “That is an understatement,” she says, her voice cold and dry. The woman, dressed in a black suit, wide-brimmed hat, and matching black trousers, flashes an unidentifiable silver badge with one hand, and levels the barrel of a handgun at you with the other. She has ebony-dark skin, cold eyes underscored by heavy bags, and short, curly hair. Two other suits flank her, both of whom say nothing and stand like statues as she speaks. Both of them rest their hands on pistols holstered beneath their suit jackets. You realize with sudden terror that you are alone in the once-busy tea room. Everyone else has cleared out. Flint’s hands immediately shoot into the air, and yours quickly follow.\n"
"“Where is the man with the red gloves now?” the woman asks. “And who exactly are you?”\n"
"You and Flint share a worried glance. What exactly have you gotten yourselves into?"

"你神經緊繃地等待著弗林特警探出現。他一定出事了，但你還記得他的存在——這是好事。你焦慮地踱著步，努力記住他的臉、他的聲音，跟引導你到此的一系列事件。答答答，也許你應該去找他，如果他遇上麻煩怎麼辦？答答答，也許他已經消失了，你是唯一記得他的人。紅手套到底是何方神聖？答答答，你等了又等。\n"
"你差點沒注意到對面的椅子被拉開，直到弗林特入座你才反應過來。他看起來沒受傷，你鬆了一口氣，但他看來有段時間沒有睡覺了。他的額頭上出現了焦慮的皺紋，雙眼布滿血絲，而且恐懼充斥其中。你感同身受。\n"
"你開玩笑說他遲到了，試著打破沉重的氣氛。弗林特警探輕笑著點頭：“我道歉。另一位ICPC的調查員失蹤了”他解釋道，焦慮與疲憊讓他的聲音充滿苦澀。“請告訴我一些好消息。”\n"
"你嘆了口氣開始回報。在過程中弗林特漫不經心的把玩著自己的手指。他說：“這證明了紅手套不是單獨行動。”\n"
"“真是輕描淡寫。”就在這時，有一個冷漠平淡的聲音打斷了你們，是一個坐在店裡另一端的女人。她穿著黑色西裝及長褲，頭戴寬邊帽。她一手拿著一枚無法辨識的銀色徽章，另一手拿著手槍指著你們。她有檀木般深色的皮膚，冷酷的眼睛下方有很深的眼袋，以及修短的捲髮。另外還有兩名身著西裝的人在她兩側，他們像雕像一般佇立，一言不發，他們的手也握著藏在西裝外套中的手槍。你突然發現原本繁忙的茶館只剩下你們兩個，其他人都被請出去了。弗林特快速舉高雙手，你也馬上照做。\n"
"那位女性開口問道：“那名戴著紅手套的人在哪裡？你們到底是誰？”\n"
"你跟弗林特交換了一個憂心的眼神，你們到底把自己牽扯進什麼了？"
