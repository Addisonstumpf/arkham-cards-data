"“This is… possibly one of the worst ideas I’ve ever had,” Agent Quinn remarks as the two of you approach the Palatine Hill. The ruins of numerous temples litter the area, once marvels of luminous white marble, decorated with intricate reliefs of ivory and delicately carved statues; now nothing more than broken vestiges and stone foundations half-buried along the hill. You try your best to reassure Quinn, but she is right—this could easily be a wild goose chase or a trap. Commissioner Taylor would certainly not be happy if she knew her agents were attempting to parley with a member of the Red Coterie. But you suspect that Aliki knows more about the strange disappearances happening all over the globe than you do, and perhaps that is more important than the mission Taylor gave you. Quinn sighs and nods in agreement. “I know. That’s why I’m here. But still…” She stops in her tracks, spotting something in the distance, and begins walking in that direction. “There—those are the ruins of the palace of Caesar Augustus, who was thought to have built the Temple of Apollo Palatinus nearby. Most scholars believe these nearby ruins to belong to the Temple of Jupiter Victor, but I wager they are in fact Apollo’s.”\n"
"You sigh and pull out the white raven whistle Aliki gave you. Now is as good a time as any to give it a shot. Worst case scenario, you’ve simply wasted your time, and Quinn’s. You put the whistle to your lips and blow. Emerging is a paradoxically distant sound, a warbling trill not unlike the shrill sound that has haunted you ever since Kathmandu. The wind picks up, sudden and chill. Quinn pulls her coat over her torso with a shudder. Then, arriving just as swiftly as the bitter wind, you spy her.\n"
"Aliki Zoni Uperetria stands just over the ancient temple ruins, her red sash a splash of flowing color in the harsh breeze. As the wind and the discordant whistle both fade, her hair settles over her face, obscuring her expression. “I hope you know what you’re doing,” Quinn murmurs to you under her breath as she approaches the haunting figure with much trepidation. The girl in the scarlet sash speaks a single word in ancient Egyptian, stopping Quinn in her tracks. The agent replies in kind, causing Aliki’s head to tilt to the side in curious understanding. Slowly, bit by bit, the two begin to converse, changing languages every other sentence like two students testing one another. You watch in awe as the two juggle ancient languages as easily as breathing.\n"
"Finally, Quinn addresses you. “You were right. She’s searching for a place where…” Aliki speaks again, and Quinn translates. “The entities you’ve encountered. She thinks the things they take—no, devour—she thinks they end up somewhere else. She’s searching for the place where they go.” You ask Quinn if she can think of any place on Earth that might be a hotspot for such activity. “There is one that I can think of,” she replies. “The Bermuda Triangle, otherwise known as The Devil’s Triangle, in the Atlantic. We’ve tried our best to keep it under wraps, but a lot of ships and even some aircraft have gone missing in that area. A few of those incidents are on my list of memory anomalies, as well. Could be some kind of… gateway.”\n"
"You tell her to ask Aliki why she is looking for this place, and the two begin conversing again. “She says that she thinks some of the Coterie were—” She pauses for a moment, struggling with the translation. “—taken? But how could that be? Our records indicate they’re accounted for. At least, the ones we know about.” You consider all that you have seen, and a nauseous feeling overtakes you. Is it possible for both to be true? Is it possible some in the Coterie are not what they seem?\n"
"You approach and ask Aliki if she would like to travel with you to this gateway, if it exists. Quinn tentatively translates your request, and the mysterious figure nods in response. Resolve, strange and fierce, like a piercing light in the abyss, fills your heart. You lift the raven whistle and say that you will summon her when you are ready. This time, Aliki nods without even waiting for Quinn’s translation. You catch just a glimpse of piercing red eyes, framed with heavy bangs, as the wind picks up again and sends her hair aflutter. You lift your coat to block the bitter chill, and naught but a moment later, Aliki Uperetria is gone, wisped along with the wind itself.\n"
"You ask Quinn if she will stick with you a little longer. “I’m not going to lie, this terrifies me,” she says in a small voice, “but I think we are on to something here. Yes. I will see this through with you to the very end. I just hope…” she quivers and averts her gaze away from you. “I just hope I am still remembered when this is done."

"“這……可能是我做過最糟糕的決定。”奎茵探員在你們攀登巴拉丁諾山時抱怨到。無數神廟的遺跡遍布這個區域，原本用光亮的白色大理石，還有精巧象牙浮雕與精雕細琢雕像建成的宏偉神廟，現在只剩下破碎的殘骸跟斷垣殘壁。你盡力安撫奎茵，但她是對的，到頭來這可能只是一場空，或甚至是個陷阱。調查官泰勒如果知道她的探員們與緋紅結社的成員合作，可能不會太高興。但你認為阿利琪對這些在全世界發生的消失事件知道的更多，而解決它也許比調查官泰勒給你的任務更加重要。奎茵嘆氣並點頭同意：“我知道，這就是為什麼我會來這裡。但是……”她突然停下來，好像看見遠方有某個東西，然後開始朝那個方向前進。“那邊，那些是奧古斯都宮殿的遺址，據說就是他在附近建造了巴拉丁諾山阿波羅神廟。很多學者都認為鄰近的遺址屬於朱比特勝利神廟，但我敢打賭它其實是阿波羅的。”\n"
"你嘆口氣並將阿利琪給你的白色渡鴉哨子拿出來，現在是放手一試的最好時機。最壞的情況不過就是你浪費了自己跟奎茵的時間罷了。你吹響了哨子，遠方傳來一聲類似從加德滿都就開始困擾著你的低泣聲。風勢逐漸增強，變得凜冽，奎茵打了個冷顫將外套拉緊。接著，就像風一樣快速，她來了。\n"
"阿利琪·佐妮·烏佩雷特里亞站在神廟的遺跡上，紅色絲帶在強風中飄盪。在風勢跟哨聲減弱後，她的頭髮重新遮住了臉龐，掩飾住她的表情。“希望你知道自己在做什麼。”奎茵邊對你呢喃著邊不安的走上前接近那個飄渺的身影。紅絲帶少女吐出一句古埃及語，奎茵停下腳步友善的回應，阿利琪歪著頭，露出了理解且饒有興趣的反應。慢慢的，一個字一個字，她們開始了對話，每幾句就切換一次語言，像兩個學生在測試彼此一樣。你驚嘆地看著她們像呼吸一樣自然的說著古老語言。\n"
"終於，奎茵示意你上前。“你是對的，她正在找尋那些你遭遇的存在的……”阿利琪再度開口，奎茵翻譯到：“去處。她認為被牠們奪走，不對，吞噬的東西，會去到某個地方。她正在搜尋它們被帶去了哪裡。”你問奎茵她是否能想到地球上哪個地方非常頻繁的發生類似事件。她回答：“我只想到一個：百慕達三角，又稱為惡魔三角，在大西洋。有許多船隻甚至飛機都在那個區域離奇失蹤，我們很努力掩蓋這些事故。我的檔案中也有一些相關的記錄，那裡會不會是某種……通道？”\n"
"你請奎茵詢問阿利琪為什麼想找到這個地方，她們兩個再度開始交談。“她說她認為有一些結社成員被——”她停頓了一下，思考著適當的用詞，“被帶走了？但怎麼可能？我們的情報指出是他們在控制這一切，至少是我們所知的那一位成員在控制。”你回想自己經歷過的事，突然感到一陣反胃。或許兩邊都是對的？或許一些結社成員不像外表看起來那樣？\n"
"你走上前詢問阿利琪是否願意跟你一同前往那個通道，如果它真的存在的話。奎茵謹慎的翻譯你的要求，然後那個神祕的身影同意了。你的決心就像刺破黑暗深淵的曙光一般，在你心中熊熊燃燒。你拿起渡鴉哨子，說在你準備就緒時會召喚她前來。阿利琪立刻點頭同意，甚至沒等奎茵進行翻譯。你看見她眼中閃過一道紅光，接著風聲大作，將她的頭髮吹起。你拉起衣領抵擋凜冽的強風，一瞬間後，阿利琪·烏佩雷特里亞就隨著強風一齊消失了。\n"
"你問奎茵是否願意再陪你走一段路。“說實話，我嚇壞了。”她小聲地說。“但我覺得我們正在做真正重要的事。我的答案是願意，我會陪你到最後。我只希望……”她顫抖著將視線移開，“我只希望結束後我還能記得這一切。”"

"Several fruitless days of searching for leads in Rome brings you to the Palazzo dei Conservatori on the Capitol Hill. Nestled among dozens of ancient statues is a bronze sculpture of the Lupa Capitolina depicting two twin babies suckling from a mother wolf. Your guide explains the twins are Romulus and Remus, the two alleged founders of Rome. “According to legend, the king, afraid for his claim to the throne, ordered them to be drowned in the Tiber. The twins were protected by the gods and taken in by a she-wolf who raised and fed them as her own. They lived in a cave until they were found and brought to safety.”\n"
"The guide leads the tour past another gallery filled with empty pedestals. You ask your guide what was on display before. “Nothing,” he chuckles. You comment on the number of empty rooms and displays, and the guide laughs dismissively. “Much has been lost over the years,” he says. Looking out over the city skyline, filled with odd dips and empty gaps, you wonder if Rome itself is disappearing."

"經歷幾天毫無收穫的調查後，你來到了卡比托利歐山上的保守宮。在古老建築群的中央是一座母狼乳嬰的青銅雕像，雕像本身是一頭母狼正在為兩名人類嬰兒哺乳的畫面。導遊解釋那對雙胞胎是羅穆盧斯與瑞摩斯，羅馬城的創立者。他說：“傳說中國王擔心他們會奪取王位，下令將他們溺死在台伯河中。但這對雙胞胎受到神明的保護，並被一頭母狼當作親生孩子一般養大，他們生活在洞穴中，一直到有人找到他們並保護他們長大。”\n"
"那名導遊領著遊客經過一個藝廊，其中有許多基座都是空的，你詢問導遊這裡以前展示著什麼東西。他輕笑著說：“什麼都沒有。”你指出過多空置的展示位是很不尋常的狀況，但導遊只是不在意地說：“漫長歲月中很多展品都遺失了。”你看向羅馬城的天際線，有許多奇怪的缺口跟不和諧的線條，你懷疑是否羅馬城本身也在逐漸消失。"
