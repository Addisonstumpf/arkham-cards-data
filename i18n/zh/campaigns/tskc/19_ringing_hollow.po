"You arrive in Sydney and immediately search for the agent described in Taylor’s dossier, finding her safehouse in an old, condemned warehouse by Botany Bay, on the eastern side of the city. She has an entire wall of filing cabinets containing years and years of research, and her table is covered in a mess of maps and photographs. “Ah, the new cell,” she regards you, flipping on a fluorescent light that coldly illuminates the room. “The name’s Quinn. The commissioner told me you might drop by.”\n"
"You ask her what kind of intel she might have to aid your investigation, which earns you a chuckle. “What don’t I have? Well, let me show you what I am looking into right now…”"

"抵達雪梨後你立刻動身尋找卷宗中提到的那位探員。你在城市東邊，植物學灣旁的一座老舊廢棄的倉庫找到她的藏身處。牆壁旁放滿了一櫃又一櫃的檔案，裡面放著無數年積累的研究報告，她的桌上雜亂無章的擺著各種地圖跟照片。“啊，新探員來了。”她打量著你，打開一盞冷光燈照亮房間。“我是奎茵，調查官告訴我你可能會來。”\n"
"你詢問她有沒有能幫助你調查的情報，結果她笑了一聲說：“有什麼是我沒有的嗎？讓我給你看看我正在調查什麼……”"

"“I have been looking into the disappearances you mentioned to Taylor. She is concerned about these events, but perhaps not as much as she should be.” She hands you a file from her table and leans back as you examine it. It’s a host of information regarding missing buildings, sites, in some cases even entire villages, all of which vanished mysteriously and without explanation. “Sound familiar?”\n"
"You nod and inform Quinn this is precisely the kind of thing that you’d been looking into before you were recruited to the Foundation. You take the time to tell Quinn everything you know regarding the strange entities you have spotted numerous times in your travels, and what their presence does to objects and people alike.\n"
"“That lines up with my research,” she says, motioning to her cluttered table. “But if that’s true, these things have been active for literally hundreds—thousands of years. And we have collectively forgotten everything that has been erased, save for a desperate few that cling to memory. Do you understand what this means?”\n"
"Other than the obvious—that humanity is in very real danger of becoming forgotten history—you aren’t sure what she is getting at.\n"
"“I have a hunch, but I cannot look into it here. Looks like I’m headed back to Britain. I know you have your own assignment to get to, but, if you can spare the time, can you come meet me in Amesbury? It is just due west of London.” Wearing a taut but determined grimace, Quinn gathers some personal belongings and leaves you with more questions than answers."

"“我正在調查你向泰勒提過的消失事件。她對這些事件有所關注，但我認為她關注的程度還不夠。”她交給你一個檔案夾後靠回椅背上。裡面記錄著許多建築、地方，甚至整個村莊都神秘且無法解釋的消失了。“聽起來很耳熟吧。”她說。\n"
"你點頭並告訴她這就是你被基石徵召前在調查的事件。你花了點時間告訴她旅程中與那個奇怪存在數次遭遇的狀況，還有牠們能對物件或人造成什麼影響。\n"
"她邊在雜亂的桌上翻找邊說：“這就是我的研究缺失的最後一片拼圖。但如果這是真的話，代表牠們已經存在了千百年之久了。而除了少數人之外，人類集體遺忘了那些被抹除的人事物，你了解這代表著什麼嗎？”\n"
"除了最明顯的影響：人類將不再記得自己的過去。你不是很確定她意指的是什麼。\n"
"“我有個直覺，但我無法在這裡證實，看來我得回英國一趟。我知道你有其他任務，但如果你能騰出時間，到埃姆斯伯里跟我碰面，就在倫敦的西邊。”奎茵帶著興奮但充滿決心的笑容收拾一些個人物品後就離開了。你感覺自己比抵達這前多了更多疑問。"

"“This is off-book, but I’ve been looking into some pretty strange events. Take a look.” She hands you a file from her table and leans back as you examine it. It’s a host of information regarding missing buildings, sites, in some cases even entire villages, all of which vanished mysteriously and without explanation. You do your best not to let your familiarity with such events show on your face. “Any of this mean anything to you?”\n"
"You don’t like lying, but telling the truth now would reveal your earlier deception to Taylor. You shake your head, telling Quinn this is new to you. “That checks out. See, that is what’s so hinky about all this. You are holding the only surviving records of any of these places. It is as though all of them were completely eradicated from history. And if that is true, who is to say the same could not happen to us?” She shudders. “The thought of being forgotten like that… even by those closest to me… it is my worst fear.”\n"
"You tell Quinn that you feel similarly, and that you wish you had more intel to give her. Her gaze, narrow with suspicion, sees right through you.\n"
"“I do not buy that for a second. Taylor might trust you, or maybe she just does not want to get her hands dirty. But I can tell when someone is lying to my face.” A grim silence hangs in the air. Finally, she exhales. “Fine. Do as you will. But if you decide to spill, you can find me in Amesbury, due west of London,” she says, packing some of her files and personal belongings in a small canvas duffel bag. You repeat her destination, curious as to why.\n"
"“Something there I want to look into,” is all she gives you. You suppose it is only fair, considering your hesitance to give her the full story. She gives you no more than a cold glance as she leaves, and you wonder if perhaps you should have warned her. But what she doesn’t know can’t hurt her… right?"

"“這不在正式紀錄中，但我正在調查一些奇怪現象，看看吧。”她交給你一個檔案夾後靠回椅背上。裡面記錄著許多建築、地方，甚至整個村莊都神秘且無法解釋的消失了。你邊看邊盡力掩飾熟悉的反應。“這些事件對你有特別意義嗎？”她問道。\n"
"你不喜歡說謊，但現在說出實話就等於承認你先前欺騙了泰勒。你搖頭，告訴奎茵你是第一次看到這些事件。“我想也是。這一切都非常離奇，你手上拿的是這些地方唯一剩下的相關記錄，就像它們完全從歷史中被抹除了一樣。如果這一切都是真的，誰知道同樣的事會不會發生在我們身上？”她打了個冷顫，“光是想到連那些我最親近的人都會將我遺忘……，這是我最大的恐懼。”\n"
"你說自己也有同感，告訴她你多希望自己能提供更多情報。她懷疑地凝視著你，彷彿要將你看穿。\n"
"“我完全不相信你的話。也許泰勒相信了，又或許她只是不想拆穿你。但當有人在我面前撒謊，我能分辨出來。”經過一陣令人不適的沉默後她終於再度開口：“算了，隨便你吧。但如果你打算坦白一點，你可以在埃姆斯伯里找到我，就在倫敦的西邊。”她邊說邊將一些檔案跟私人物品放進帆布旅行袋中，你重複她的目的地，好奇地詢問原因。\n"
"她只說了一句：“我要到那裡確認一些事。”由於你沒告知她真相，你覺得她的反應很公平。她離開前沒說任何話，只是冷冷地看了你一眼。你思考著自己是否該警告她，但如果她不知道，就不需要擔心……對吧？"

"You arrive in Sydney and immediately search for the agent described in Taylor’s dossier, but everywhere you search, there appears to be no trace of her, nor any memory of her among the locals. Feeling worried, you redouble your efforts and eventually track her to an old, condemned warehouse by the bay on the eastern side of the city. Inside is an entire wall of filing cabinets containing years and years of research, and a table covered in a mess of maps and photographs. But there is no sign of Agent Quinn.\n"
"Judging from her recent notes, she appeared to have been researching the same kind of paranormal events you’d been looking into before you were recruited to the Foundation—missing buildings, sites, in some cases even entire villages, all of which vanished mysteriously and without explanation. But if she came to any conclusions, you find no evidence of it.\n"
"With no other leads, you depart, filing a report on Quinn’s disappearance for the commissioner. You hope she is simply in hiding somewhere, but your instincts tell you otherwise."

"抵達雪梨後你立刻動身尋找卷宗中提到的那位探員。但不管你如何搜尋都無法找到她的蹤跡，當地人對她也完全沒有記憶。你有不祥的預感，加強了搜尋的行動，最後你追蹤到在城市東邊海灣旁的一座老舊廢棄的倉庫。裡面的牆壁旁放滿了一櫃又一櫃的檔案，裡面放著無數年積累的研究報告，辦公桌上雜亂無章的擺著各種地圖跟照片。但完全沒有奎茵探員的蹤影。\n"
"根據她最近的筆記，她研究的正是你被基石徵召前在調查的消失事件。許多建築、地方，甚至整個村莊都神秘且無法解釋的消失了。但你找不到任何她是否有得出結論的證據。\n"
"由於沒有其他線索可循，你只好離開，並向調查官報告奎茵失蹤的事。你希望她只是躲藏起來了，但直覺告訴你並不是這樣。"
