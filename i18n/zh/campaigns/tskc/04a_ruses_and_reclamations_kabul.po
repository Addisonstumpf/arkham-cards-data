msgid "You search every known Coterie sanctum and safehouse in this region, looking high and low for the villain who stole your precious cargo, but find nothing. Either they’re not here, or they’re so well hidden that searching any more thoroughly would be a waste of time. Resigned, you plan your next move."
msgstr "你搜尋了每個已知的結社聖殿跟藏身處，四處尋找失竊的珍貴物件，但一無所獲。如果不是東西不在這裡，那就是他們藏的過於隱密，再深入搜尋會花費過多時間。你放棄搜索，計畫下一步行動。"

msgid "You finally narrow down your quarry and find their safehouse. Before rushing in, you lay low and wait for the right time to strike. With the element of surprise on your side, you tailor your approach to your foe…"
msgstr "你終於找到獵物的藏身處。但在行動前，你潛伏起來並等待著適當的時機。既然擁有突襲的優勢，你仔細的計畫著行動細節……"

msgid "With a foe as enigmatic and potentially dangerous as The Red-Gloved Man, perhaps it is best to avoid confrontation altogether. You wait until you spot him leaving the sanctum and then start picking the lock of the same entrance… only, to your surprise, he has left it unlocked. You can almost imagine his blank stare from the shadows, mocking your every move. Does he know you’re here? Why steal from you only to hand the stolen objects back to you on a silver platter? In the end, you decide it is best to not look a gift horse in the mouth—after all, you’re not about to waste this opportunity. You grab the stolen relic and make your escape, wondering all the while the true motivations of the mysterious man."
msgstr "對付像紅手套這種難以預測且有潛在危險的對手，最好的辦法就是不要與他接觸。你耐心等待，直到他離開聖殿。你上前想試著打開門鎖，卻驚訝的發現門沒有上鎖。你幾乎可以想像他藏身在陰影中看著你，嘲笑你的一舉一動。難道他知道你來了嗎？但為什麼要偷走你的東西後又雙手奉還呢？最後你決定不要讓到手的東西飛了，畢竟你不能浪費這次機會。你拿走失竊的物件後離開，思索著那個神祕男子的真實目的。"

msgid "You sneak into Amaranth’s sanctum and find what she stole piled in the corner of a cavernous foyer. A weak roar breaks the silence, and you see a tattered lion glowering at you from the dark. Your shock turns to disgust as you watch the poor creature struggle to stand: it is too decayed to even move. “You got what you came for. Now leave,” says a voice from the shadows. Squinting your eyes, you see Amaranth bent over the lion, her cheeks wet with tears. “Khalid, please,” she whispers. The lion lets out a weak growl, then flops onto its side to expose its rotten belly. “I told you to leave!” Amaranth screams. Your disgust turns to pity as you make your exit."
msgstr "你你潛入永生花的聖殿，發現失竊的物品堆在一個洞穴般的門廊前。突然一聲虛弱的吼聲打破寂靜，你看見一頭獅子從黑暗中怒視著你，你的驚訝轉為噁心，那隻獅子已經腐爛到幾乎站不穩，也無法移動。陰影中傳出一個聲音：“你拿到你想要的了，滾吧。”你瞇起眼睛，看見永生花靠在獅子身側，淚水滑落臉頰。“凱利德，拜託。”獅子發出一聲虛弱的呻吟，側身倒下露出腐爛的肚腹。“我叫你滾！”永生花對你尖叫。你離開時，心中的噁心感轉為憐憫。"

msgid "Knowing the knight from Alexandria, you doubt he would dirty his hands personally—he must have sent enforcers to do his job for him. It’s likely he has set guards inside the safehouse, as well. Sneaking is probably out of the question, so you decide on a quick, direct approach: take the guards by surprise, grab what’s yours, and get out before they can respond with force. The job is clean and over in a matter of seconds. With the knight’s enforcers surely on your tail, you flee the city as fast as you can with your prize in tow."
msgstr "就你對亞歷山卓那位騎士的認識，他絕對不會親自動手，必定是讓手下代勞。看來他在藏身處設置了守衛，偷溜進去是不可能了。所以你計畫進行一次快速的直接侵入，出奇不意的打倒守衛，拿走你的東西，然後在他們動員前逃離。行動乾淨俐落的完成了，在騎士爪牙的追擊下，你盡速帶著戰利品離開了城市。"

msgid "You and La Chica Roja have been playing this cat-and-mouse game for weeks. You’ve tracked her down enough times by now to know her modus operandi perhaps better than any other living person. It’s even starting to become a little fun, this tête-à-tête. You sneak into her sanctum and locate the relic in a hiding place not unlike where a remnant of the Weeping Lady was found during your last encounter. With a bit of a chuckle, you replace it with a little calling card of your own and escape without notice. As you leave the city later that night, a bystander slips a red envelope onto your person, bearing a message: “Nice one. Let’s play again some time.”"
msgstr "你跟紅姑娘進行這個貓抓老鼠的遊戲好幾個禮拜了。你已經追蹤到她數次，足以讓你比世界上任何人都清楚她的行動模式，這場捉迷藏甚至變得有點有趣。你潛入她所在的聖殿，她這次將密鑰藏在與上次你們爭奪泣血女士碎片時截然不同的地方。你輕笑著將密鑰換成自己的名片，然後神不知鬼不覺的離開。當晚你離開城市時，一名路人塞了個紅色信封到你手中，裡面寫著：“有一套，下次我們再玩玩。”"

msgid "The Beast is no doubt the most violent and unpredictable foe you have encountered thus far. You count yourself lucky to have been out of your hotel room when it was sacked, or you would surely be dead. But from your mission in Alexandria, you know the creature has a weakness—it must hibernate from time to time. Quiet as a mouse, you slip into its sanctum unnoticed, the Beast’s rumbling breath emanating from a chamber deeper beneath your feet. Your heart races as you creep throughout the building, knowing any false step could spell your doom. The moment you grab the stolen artifact, the Beast begins to stir, and you rush to the exit. Even after putting miles between you and the creature’s lair, you can still hear its howls of anger and hate."
msgstr "野獸無疑是你面對的對手中最危險且無法預測的。你對於在牠闖入旅館房間盜竊時自己並不在場感到幸運，不然你必定會沒命。但就在亞歷山卓的經驗來看，你知道牠有個弱點——必須時不時地陷入沉眠。你像老鼠一樣安靜的潛入聖殿，野獸沉重的呼吸聲從你腳下深處的密室傳來。你的心跳在搜尋時快速跳動，心知踏錯一步就會惹來殺身之禍。你拿到失竊物件的當下，野獸開始輾轉反側，你立即跑向出口。即使與野獸的巢穴已經相聚數哩，你還是能聽見牠憤恨的咆嘯。"

msgid "Faceless servants with scarlet collars and wings of darkness circle the watcher’s sanctum overhead. You move carefully under the cover of night, hoping to avoid detection. The man’s sanctum is more akin to a workshop, filled with torturous implements and strange, arcane tools. Among the many instruments is that which he stole from you, placed in the center of one of his workbenches as though he was studying it. The moment you grab it and move to escape, you hear his startled voice from another doorway. “Who is there?” Two empty eyesockets glare in your direction as you turn to face him. “Who is that?” He scrambles to find his ruby spectacles, but you are long gone before he is able to put them on."
msgstr "訕笑監視者的聖殿徘徊著鮮紅衣領的無臉奴僕，黑暗的有翼怪物盤旋在聖殿上方。你小心翼翼的藉著夜色的掩護躲過監視。這座聖殿看起來更像是實驗室，放著許多刑具與施法用品。失竊的密鑰就放在其中一張工作檯上，看起來他正在研究它。你拿起密鑰的同時，走廊上傳來一聲警戒的聲音：“是誰？”你轉身看見一雙空洞的眼眶看向你這邊。“誰在那裡？”他匆忙地想戴上紅寶石眼鏡，但你在他能看清前早已離開。"

msgid "To your surprise, the sanctum is completely empty. Not just empty, but abandoned entirely, perhaps for many years before you ever arrived. You wander through darkened halls and dusty, cobwebbed chambers, until finally you reach an old, decrepit bedroom. A full-length mirror adorns one wall, covered in dust and grime. Spotting a strange reflection in the glass, you wipe away the filth, revealing the haunting figure of Aliki behind you, her long, dark hair covering her eyes as she reaches for your neck. When you turn again, she is gone, but the feeling of something clenching around your neck remains. Spying your stolen Key on a nearby vanity, you snatch it and run, bursting through the door of the sanctum with a resounding thud. You don’t stop running until you have left the city behind."
msgstr "你很驚訝整座聖殿都空蕩蕩的。不只是空的，看來在你到來前就廢棄已久了。你走在黑暗的大廳跟塵封結網的房間之間，最後你找到一間老舊的臥室。一面全身鏡掛在牆上，覆滿灰塵。你看見鏡中有奇怪的倒影，於是你拂去塵土，看見阿利琪飄渺的身影就站在你身後，烏黑的長髮在她將手伸向你的脖子時掩蓋了她的臉龐。你轉身看時她就消失了，但你的脖子上依然殘留著壓迫感。你瞄見失竊的密鑰就放在旁邊的梳妝台上，你抓起它開始奔跑，在一聲巨響迴盪中你衝出了聖殿大門，在離開城市前都沒有停下腳步。"

msgid "If there’s one thing you know about Thorne, it’s that they won’t pass on an opportunity to make a deal. Rather than sneak in, you knock on the front door of their sanctum and are admitted by several smooth, attractive attendants. Thorne sits at the head of a long table, hands steepled. “What a delight! I had no idea you were coming,” they smile brightly, then gesture for you to sit. Drinks and a lavish meal are served, and eventually you steer the conversation toward returning what they stole. “Ah yes. ‘Keys.’ It’s always about ‘Keys,’ isn’t it?” They pour another glass of wine. “Things have changed. I suppose I could be amenable to such an exchange. But only if you make it worth my while.” It takes nearly an hour to come up with compensation enough for Thorne to change their mind, but eventually you leave their sanctum with your stolen relic… and a bit poorer, besides."
msgstr "如果你對索恩有任何認識，那就是他不會放過任何做交易的機會。所以你沒有偷溜進去，反而敲響了聖殿的大門，幾名有禮迷人的侍者引你入內。索恩坐在一張長桌的主位，張開雙臂說道：“真是個驚喜，我不知道你要來。”他愉悅的笑著，示意你入座。精緻的餐點與飲品被送上桌，最後你終於提起歸還失竊密鑰的話題。“啊，是的，‘密鑰’，什麼都跟‘密鑰’有關，對吧？”他邊幫自己倒了另一杯酒邊說：“情況有變，我想我能接受這個提議，但你要讓我覺得物有所值。”你們討論了將近一小時才達成讓索恩滿意的共識。你最後帶著失竊的密鑰離開，但也變得更窮了……。"

msgid "You sneak into Desi’s safehouse and are stunned to find that it is no vault or Coterie hideout, but a fully stocked bar with patrons in boisterous revelry. A bouncer in a pinstripe suit stops you as you enter, but before you can protest or fight back, you hear Desi’s voice call out: “Hey. It’s fine. Let ‘em in.” The bouncer relents, and you sit at a booth across from your adversary. “Guessing I know what this is about. Tell you what: I’m in a good mood. Have a drink or two and I’ll play you for it,” he says, shuffling a deck of cards. Seeing your expression, he grins. “Oh, lighten up. I’m not like those others. One hand. Then we call it even and go our separate ways.” Considering the circumstances, you decide it best to play along—literally. As luck would have it, three jacks is more than enough to beat Desi’s pair. You end up leaving shortly after with your Key reclaimed and no worse for the wear, wondering how much of a sore loser Desi and his crew might be."
msgstr "你潛入德西的藏身處時驚訝地發現這裡不是金庫也不是結社據點。而是一個充滿酒客與狂歡舞者的熱鬧酒吧。一名身穿條紋西裝的保鑣擋住你的去路，在你開口或動手前，德西的聲音傳來：“嘿，沒關係。讓他們進來。”保鑣讓路，你走進包廂，坐在你的對手對面。“我猜我知道你為何而來。這樣吧，我現在心情不錯，你來喝幾杯，我們來賭一把。”他邊說邊洗著一副撲克牌。看到你的表情時他笑了：“別這樣，開心一點。我跟其他那些人不一樣，來一局，然後我們就扯平了，各走各的。”考慮到你的處境，你決定最好還是跟他玩一場。幸運女神眷顧你，三張傑克贏了德西的一對。你很快帶著密鑰毫髮無傷的離開，希望德西跟他的手下沒有那麼輸不起。"

msgid "Given how dangerous Tzu San Niang was while in possession of a Key, you decide a direct confrontation is out of the question. Stealth is by far the better option. You sneak into a large industrial complex after dark and locate what she stole behind a locked door. As you pick the locks, you hear a lilting voice echo off of the narrow corridors. A haunting song in Shanghainese fills the empty factory. Working quickly, you reclaim the stolen artifact and retrace your steps to the exit, looking over your shoulder at every turn. The song lingers in your memory long after you make your escape."
msgstr "你很清楚梓三娘持有密鑰時有多危險，所以排除直接接觸的選項，潛入會是比較好的選擇。天黑後你潛入一間工廠，鎖定她藏著密鑰的房間。正當你試著開鎖時，哼歌聲從狹窄的走廊傳來，一首上海曲調縈繞在空蕩的廠房中。你加快動作，拿走密鑰後原路走向出口，每個轉彎處都不禁回頭查看。即使在逃離後許久，那首曲調仍在你腦海中陰魂不散。"

msgid "Update the Keys section of your Campaign Log such that the Key(s) that were stolen return to their original bearers."
msgstr "更新劇本日誌中密鑰的部分，使遭竊的密鑰回到其原先的承受者。"

msgid "Each investigator earns 1 experience, plus 1 additional experience for each tally mark recorded next to wrong leads."
msgstr "每位調查員獲得1點經驗值，錯誤線索旁每有一個標記，再額外獲得1點經驗值。"

msgid "Cross off “14–C” on each of the remaining locations in the Campaign Log."
msgstr "劃掉劇本日誌中每個剩餘地點上的“14-C”。"
