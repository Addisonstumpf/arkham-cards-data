"On the train into Hong Kong, Agent Flint shares his current lead with you. “Tzu San Niang is due to meet with her new business partners this afternoon at a local teahouse. From what I gather, they’re a real rogue’s gallery of scumbags. The type that makes their fortunes by exploiting their workers to death. She’s so drawn to these types, it gives me a theory. She’s not just taking these jobs because they pay well. Time and again she goes for these deals where she can help the British at the expense of the common folk. It’s like she’s… attracted to the suffering she causes. Maybe worse.”\n"
"Before you can discuss this theory in more depth, your train arrives at its stop. You and Flint hurry onto the platform and rush to the teahouse, but you arrive too late: a telltale red parasol is sifting through the street crowd, heading swiftly away. You follow the parasol with your eyes as its bearer steps into a nearby alleyway. Flint whispers to you to stay, but you can’t while your quarry is so close.\n"
"The moment you enter the alleyway, Tzu San Niang turns and looks you in the eye. “I am used to attention,” she croons, “but I heard you were a little too interested in me.” She raps the tip of her parasol onto the street, and a burst of silvery energy rushes through the ground, jumping into your body. Your skin goes suddenly numb, and you collapse to the ground. The painful pinprick sensation of a sleeping limb takes over your entire body. Tzu San Niang smiles, puts her parasol over her shoulder, and walks away. She gets a few yards away and, apparently believing she is out of earshot, she tells her entourage: “We are done here. The Foundation is on to us. Eliminate them and move on to the Selangor Club harvest.”\n"
"You hear feet shuffling in your direction, but before any reckoning comes, Flint picks you up and drags you back out to the street, where the crowd and broad daylight might keep you from overt harm… for now. As the sensation in your limbs returns, Flint muses aloud. “The Royal Selangor Club—that’s a social club in Kuala Lumpur. Come on, we have no time to lose.” He helps you to your feet, but you’re still recovering from the blast of energy that sent your body and mind reeling. The parasol isn’t just a Coterie insignia after all—it is a Key!"

"在前往香港的火車上，弗林特探員跟你分享他目前所知的情報。“梓三娘會在下午跟她的生意夥伴在當地的茶室會面。就我蒐集到的資訊來看，他們都是一群強盜惡棍，靠著將勞工剝削至死來賺取利潤。她似乎特別受這些人吸引，所以我有個假設：她不只是為了高額報酬而已。從她對於幫助英國佬剝削平民的積極程度看來，她似乎……以她造成的苦難為樂，或甚至更糟。”\n"
"在你們有機會深入討論前”火車到站了。你跟弗林特踏上月台並急忙趕往茶室，但你們還是太遲了。你們在人群中看到一把鮮紅的陽傘正在快速遠離。你們跟蹤她，看見她轉進一條小巷。弗林特要求你在這等待，但你不願意在獵物近在咫尺的狀況下袖手旁觀。\n"
"你們轉進巷子的同時，梓三娘轉身與你們四目相對。她用銀鈴般的聲音說：“我很習慣引人矚目，但你們對我過於有興趣了。”她將陽傘的尖端往地上拍，一道銀色的能量爆出，沿著地面襲向你們。你感到一陣麻木，感覺像千萬根針刺在你每一寸皮膚上，你在劇痛中倒在地上。梓三娘笑了，她將陽傘放回肩上，轉身離開。她走到認為你們聽不見的距離後跟她的隨從說：“這裡的事結束了，基石盯上我們了，把他們處理掉，然後前往雪蘭莪俱樂部進行收割。”\n"
"你聽見腳步聲向你靠近，但在他們動手前，弗林特扶起你並將你拖到陽光普照的大街上，也許擁擠的人群跟光線能暫時保護你們。等你終於能再度控制自己的身體時，弗林特說：“皇家雪蘭莪俱樂部，那是位於吉隆坡的的社交俱樂部。走吧，沒時間浪費了。”他扶你起身，你還沒完全從那股力量造成的無力及暈眩中恢復過來。鮮紅的陽傘不只是結社的身份象徵——它是一把密鑰！"

"You meet Agent Flint at the Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical gardens. He shakes your hand and leans in close. “Do you have a tail?” he asks. You assure him you do not. You have been careful.\n"
"He updates you on the case while the two of you stroll through the gardens, looking to all the world like normal tourists. He explains that the lady with the red parasol is using the name Tzu San Niang, and that she has made an international business out of helping the British expand their empire, often using the most brutal methods. Her silver tongue and negotiating skills are apparently the thing of legend: she can convince worker unions to tolerate abysmal conditions, local governments to accept the extraction of natural resources without batting an eye, and worse.\n"
"“We can’t be too careful,” Flint warns. “Obviously, Ms. Tzu is no one to be trifled with, but it’s that parasol that’s the key to her operation, if you’ll pardon my pun. I think it actually is giving her the ability to sway minds.”\n"
"You can’t object—the evidence is piling up. Flint’s initial hunch was right. “What’s worse is that she already suspects we’re on to her. I had a Coterie operative sniffing me out just earlier this week. Luckily, I managed to get the upper hand. Found his safehouse before he found mine. And the best part?” He gives you a sly grin. “He had an itinerary on him. They’re headed to the Royal Selangor Club next. It’s a social club in Kuala Lumpur, for the wealthy elite. Care to join me?”"

"你在香港的動植物公園與弗林特見面。他跟你握手，在你耳邊低聲問：“你有被跟蹤嗎？”你向他保證沒有，你非常小心。\n"
"你們在公園中漫步，交換著情報，看起來就像普通的遊客一樣。他說紅傘女子使用梓三娘這個名字，她正在幫助一群英國人擴張國際事業的版圖，通常藉由殘酷的手段。她的能言善道跟談判技巧蔚為傳奇。她可以讓工會接受最嚴苛的條件；讓政府機關眼睛都不眨一下就同意耗盡天然資源的提案，還有其他更糟的事。\n"
"弗林特警告你：“多小心都不為過，很明顯這位梓小姐絕非善類。但她的陽傘才是這一切的鑰匙，請原諒我用雙關語。我認為就是密鑰賦予了她操控心智的能力。”\n"
"你無法反駁，證據擺在眼前，弗林特一開始的直覺是對的。“更糟的是她已經在懷疑我們盯上她了。前幾天我發現有一名結社成員在打探我的行蹤。幸運的是我佔了上風，在他找上我前，我先找到了他的藏身處。你猜最棒的是什麼？”他狡詐地笑了一下。“他帶著一份旅行計畫，他們接下來前往皇家雪蘭莪俱樂部，一個在吉隆坡的社交俱樂部，專門為有錢人打造的。你要一起來嗎？”"

"You reply to Agent Flint’s telegram, but he never returns your message. You head to Flint’s last known hotel to inquire personally, but they tell you that he never received your telegram. In fact, according to the concierge, he hasn’t been back in several days. You decide that the Coterie must be behind this disappearance, and that the best way of finding Flint is to find the lady with the red parasol.\n"
"For days you search for signs of the Coterie, but find nothing. You establish the trust of some business contacts and begin to ask them about the lady with the red parasol. Most of them pretend to know nothing, but eventually you hear about a railway being constructed in Malaysia. The rail was delayed, but they sent a negotiator in to reach an agreement, saying “no one says no to her.” Maybe Flint simply went to Kuala Lumpur to investigate on his own, but…\n"
"A lump forms in your throat. You suspect the worst."

"你回覆弗林特的電報後一直沒收到回音，所以你親自前往弗林特最後提到的旅館想找到他的行蹤。但櫃台人員告訴你他沒有收到你的電報，事實上，他已經好幾天沒有回到這裡了。你認為結社一定跟他的失蹤有關，找到他的最大希望就是先找到那個紅傘女子。\n"
"你花了好幾天搜尋結社的行蹤，卻一無所獲。但你跟幾位當地的生意人搭上線，並詢問他們關於紅傘女子的事。他們一開始都假裝一無所知，但最後你終於問出在馬來西亞有一項鐵路工程正在延宕之中，他們派了一個談判專家過去，據說沒有人能對她說“不”。也許弗林特只是獨自前往了吉隆坡，但是……\n"
"一股不祥的預感湧上心頭，你做著最壞的打算。"
