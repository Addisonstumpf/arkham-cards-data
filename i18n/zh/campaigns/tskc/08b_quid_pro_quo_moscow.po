"The Foundation’s base of operations in Moscow is just a five minute walk from St. Basil’s Cathedral: a nondescript door set into a modern constructivist structure overlooking a cobbled street. The corridor inside feeds into a cramped stairwell that descends deeper than you could have anticipated, to a red door set in a flaking whitewashed wall. After identifying yourself, you are led into a long well-lit hallway with lavish carpeting.\n"
"“It seems you follow instructions well,” says a voice. You turn to see a tall, athletic woman in a well-tailored suit. “Valeriya Antonova. We have met before. Call me Lera. Please, follow me.” Agent Antonova leads you through a labyrinthine set of passageways, past a set of double doors, to a white-tiled room flecked with grime and what you hope is red rust. On an operating table in the center, what looks like a person is strapped to a metal slab, restrained with tight leather straps. Looking at the humanoid shape makes your head swim: its features are blurred as if in constant motion, like a hummingbird in flight. You catch only glimpses of its features: a stygian eye, clenched teeth, nervous twitching.\n"
"“Lera,” another agent interrupts. “The Komissar needs your attention.” Agent Antonova looks sternly to you. “This is a paradimensional being. Please keep your distance. I will be but a moment away.” The agent leaves. As you look at the sharp implements mounted to the wall of the lab, you wonder what experiments the being has endured. Judging by the subject’s well-tailored black suit, you wonder if it used to be a Foundation agent. After a minute of silence, it begins to flail around on the table, widening and shrinking its “mouth” to a wide dark O, always facing you. You keep your distance, trying to look away.\n"
"“Please excuse me,” Agent Antonova re-enters the room. The being on the table stops flailing. “There is another matter I must attend to. Unfortunately, we do not have the resources to escort you around our facilities, so I must ask you to leave. However, the Foundation does wish to assist in any way it can. Please tell us what we can do for you.”"

"基石在莫斯科的設施離聖巴希爾教堂只有五分鐘的路程。你走進一棟眺望鵝卵石街道的結構主義的現代建築，裡面有一扇沒標註任何東西的門。門後的走廊引領你到一座狹窄的樓梯井，你走下意想之外的深度，站在一面白牆上的紅色大門前，在通報身份後，你被帶進鋪著豪華地毯、照明良好的廊道。\n"
"“看來你有仔細看指示。”一個聲音說到。你轉身看見一名高挑勻稱的女性，穿著合身的西裝。“我是瓦蕾莉雅·安東諾娃。我們之前見過，你可以叫我蕾拉。請隨我來。”安東諾娃探員帶領你穿越迷宮般的走道，走過一扇雙層門，進入一個鋪著白色地磚的房間，你暗自希望牆上紅色的斑點指是鐵鏽的痕跡。在中央的手術檯上有一個人型的身影被用皮帶綁在金屬製的檯面上。看著這個人型身影，你感到一陣暈眩，它的身形模糊，就像是蜂鳥快速振動翅膀產生的殘影。你只能辨認出一些特徵：陰森的雙眼、咬牙切齒的表情，跟緊繃的抽搐。\n"
"“蕾拉，調查官找你。”一名探員打斷你們。安東諾娃探員嚴肅的看向你說：“這是一個超次元的產物，請保持安全距離，我馬上回來。”然後離開了。你看著實驗室牆上的銳利工具，不禁想像這個生物正經歷什麼樣的實驗。就牠身上合身的西裝來看，牠也許曾經是一名基石探員。在一陣寂靜後，牠開始劇烈掙扎，牠的“嘴巴”張開又收縮，形成一個詭異的黑色圓形，而且牠一直面向你的方向。你保持距離，試著不去看牠。\n"
"“我很抱歉。”安東諾娃探員回到了房間。檯子上的生物不再掙扎。“我必須去處理其他事，很不幸的是我們沒有其他人員能帶你在設施中流覽，所以我必須請你離開了。但基石希望能盡力幫助你，請告訴我我們能幫上你什麼忙?”"

msgid "Agent Antonova digs through some old files and pulls out a dossier filled with information on a man named Desiderio Delgado Álvarez. “From what we can tell, ‘Subject #28–I lived a perfectly mundane life in Havana until the age of 19, when his involvement with organized crime drew the attention of the Coterie. “ You wonder aloud if he is a rum-runner, and she shakes her head sternly. “Quite the opposite, in fact. Desiderio’s brother was the one involved in such matters, before his murder at the hands of a rival gang. It seems Desiderio then acquired a Key, and was using it to take revenge. Hence the Coterie involvement. Seeing his talent, they decided to induct him.”"
msgstr "安東諾娃探員在一疊檔案中翻找，最後拉出一份寫著德西德里奧·德爾加多·阿瓦雷茲名字的檔案。“就我們所知，目標#28-I在19歲前都過著非常平凡的生活。一直到他涉入組織犯罪時才引起結社的注意。”你開口問是不是因為走私蘭姆酒，但她搖搖頭說：“正好相反，他的哥哥才是在做這個勾當的，至少一直到他被敵對幫派殺害前。看起來德西德里奧不知從哪取得了一件密鑰，並利用它來復仇。最後結社介入，由於他展現出的潛力，他們將他吸收進組織中。”"
