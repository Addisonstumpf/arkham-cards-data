"“Talk,” Commissioner Taylor commands.\n"
"You shift in your uncomfortable metal chair, the glaring light of her interrogation lamp nearly blinding you. One wall of the sterile interrogation chamber is covered by a black mirror that reflects you and the Commissioner sitting across a desk from one another, your faces blanched under heavy white light. Knowing the Foundation, several operatives are watching and recording your every move from behind the mirror. A thick dossier lies unopened on the desk between you and Taylor."

"“說吧。”調查官泰勒用命令的口吻說。\n"
"你不適地在金屬椅中扭動，審訊燈照的你幾乎看不見。審訊室其中一面牆上裝著黑色的鏡子，鏡子中是你與調查官隔著桌子相對而坐的倒影，你的臉色在强烈的白光下顯得十分蒼白。依照基石的慣性，鏡子另一邊應該有許多人正在看著你們，並記錄下你的一字一句。一份蓋著的厚重檔案放在你跟泰勒之間。"

"Rather than answer directly, you ask instead what Taylor expected when she conscripted a random set of people into a Foundation cell. She looks genuinely caught off-guard as you explain your work and your role in assisting the Red Coterie to suppress what was clearly the greatest threat to humanity. The commissioner’s eye arches as you lean back in your seat in a gesture of casual indifference.\n"
"“I… see,” she visibly suppresses a grimace. You see her gaze linger on your crimson regalia. “You were hired for your curiosity, ingenuity, and independence. A statement which—may I remind you—is not to be taken as any form of compliment or commendation. It was an assumed risk that you might fall in with the Red Coterie, but one which I assured senior command was highly unlikely, if not impossible.”\n"
"A heavy silence falls as the commissioner makes a near-imperceptible nod at the black mirror to her left, then looks back to you.\n"
"“This, then, is no longer a briefing, but a negotiation. Understand that your role at the Foundation is terminated forthwith. All assets and privileges you previously enjoyed are rescinded, along with your prior rank and compensation.” You detect a hint of regret in her voice as she locks eyes with you. “Instead, let us view this as an opportunity. We have been at odds with the Coterie long enough; perhaps it is time that we worked together.”\n"
"Beyond the commissioner’s steely-eyed professionalism, you sense something else in her voice. Is it respect? She gives you an intense look.\n"
"“The Foundation and the Coterie, as partners. What do you say? Are you in?”"

"你沒有直接回答問題，而是詢問泰勒，她當時招募來歷不明的你進入基石時，希望得到什麼。顯然這個問題讓她措手不及。你接著開始解釋你是如何與緋紅結社合作，以及協助他們對抗也許是人類生存的最大威脅。你說完後不屑的靠回椅背，調查官的眼睛圓睜著。\n"
"“我……懂了。”她很努力壓抑著表情，你注意到她的視線落在你身上的一抹紅色。“你是因為你的好奇心、跳脫的思維與獨立性而被招募的，請容我提醒，以上評價並無讚美的意思。你轉而加入緋紅結社的風險一直都存在，但我個人認為機率極小，甚至不可能。”\n"
"一段沉重的靜默後，調查官幾乎無法察覺地轉頭向黑色鏡子點點頭，然後轉回來看著你。\n"
"“既然如此，那這就不再是場報告了，而是協商。你在基石的任期結束了，所有之前賦予你的資源與特權將被收回，還有你的職位與補償金。”你從她的語氣跟眼神中捕捉到一絲愧疚。“但讓我們將此視為一個契機，我們已經與結社爭鬥太久了，也許是時候讓我們握手言和了。”\n"
"在調查官堅定的眼神與公事公辦的態度之外，你從她的聲音中感覺到其他東西，是尊敬嗎？她認真的看著你。\n"
"“基石與結社，攜手合作。你怎麼說？同意嗎？”"

"You find yourself awkwardly repeating events and names as you struggle to relay your experience to the commissioner. Throughout it all, Taylor remains silent, listening to your various rabbit trails and accounts of events with an air of reserve. When you have finished, she slides a glass of water across the desktop toward you. You see your shadowy reflection glimmer within the black mirror in the corner of your eye.\n"
"“What an… unrestrained account,” she says matter-of-factly. A heavy silence falls as the commissioner makes a near-imperceptible nod at the black mirror to her left, then looks back to you.\n"
"“The Foundation thanks you for your service. Understand that everything you have done during your tenure with the Foundation is classified, and you are bound under threat of execution to never share this account with another soul: living or dead.” She locks eyes with you. “Do you understand?”\n"
"You nod, and the commissioner goes on. “It goes without saying, but I must inform you that your temporary ‘cell’ has been disavowed and all assets acquired during your Foundation service will be retained for further study and research. Your account of all events involving paracausal disturbance will be extracted, analyzed, and preserved for future analysis.”"

"你發現自己尷尬的重複著事件跟姓名，試著在隱瞞部分事實的狀態下交代來龍去脈。泰勒靜靜的聽著你雜亂無章的故事跟語帶保留的陳述。當你說完時，她隔著桌子遞給你一杯水，你的餘光看見黑色鏡面上自己的倒影散發著微光。\n"
"“多麼……複雜的陳述。”她仔細斟酌著用詞。一段沉重的靜默後，調查官幾乎無法察覺地轉頭向黑色鏡子點點頭，然後轉回來看著你。\n"
"“基石感謝你的付出。請注意你在基石服務的這段時間是最高機密，若你洩漏相關的資訊給任何存在，無論有形或無形，都將面臨處決的懲罰。”她看著你的眼睛說，“你明白了嗎？”\n"
"你點頭，調查官繼續說道：“雖然是理所當然，但我還是必須通知你，你臨時的‘探員’身份將被取消，所有屬於基石的資產都將被回收並受到進一步的檢視與調查。所有你介入的超自然事件將被記錄歸檔並進行分析，留存以做為未來的情報使用。”"

"Commissioner Taylor produces a black leather briefcase from behind the desk, opens it, and slides a Foundation badge across the table to you. “Bureaucratic flim-flam, of course. Your cell has been dissolved and you have received approval to join the Foundation with full clearance, full stop. Whether or not you wish to join is irrelevant; you have seen and accomplished too much to return to civilian life.”\n"
"The badge gleams in the harsh light as you turn it over in your hand. It has surprising heft. The sudden weight of everything that has happened hits you as your thumb plays over the grooves and ridges of the metal surface. Taylor flips open the dossier on the table and continues.\n"
"“Your date of hire is yesterday. Don’t worry: you will receive backpay as well as a sizeable compensation package for your work on the case. Which—on that—we are considering labeling ‘The Scarlet Keys.’ It has a nice ring to it, though it is a bit extravagant for my taste.”\n"

"調查官泰勒從桌子後拿出一個黑色的手提箱，打開後將一枚基石徽章滑過桌面給你。“一些繁瑣的文書工作，你懂的。你的臨時身份已經取消，轉為正式、永久的職位。你願不願意接受無關緊要，你已經知道太多、也貢獻太多以致於我們無法讓你回歸平民身份。”\n"
"你將徽章在手中翻來覆去，它在強烈的光線下閃閃發光，你驚訝著它的重量。你用手指感受金屬表面的高低深淺的同時，回想著這段時間的經歷與肩負的重任。泰勒翻開桌上的檔案繼續說。\n"
"“你被雇用的日期是昨天。別擔心，你會收到這段期間的完整薪資，還有針對這次事件的鉅額補償。這次事件我們打算稱為‘緋紅密鑰’。雖然我個人覺得有點太誇張了，但聽起來的確還不錯。”\n"

"Commissioner Taylor opens the dossier in front of her and slides a set of tickets across the table to you.\n"
"“These are one-way tickets that will take you anywhere in the world, no questions asked. Given your troublesome curiosity, I recommend you go somewhere quiet and forgettable, assume an alias, and take up a profession that does not allow you so much free time or thinking. Oh, and stop wearing that,” she says, gesturing off-handedly at your appearance.\n"
"You interrupt and try to explain yourself. The commissioner holds up one hand to silence you.\n"
"“In truth, I must inform you that you are getting off rather easily here. If the higher-ups had their say, you would have been summarily executed for your reckless handling of this case. The word ‘collusion’ was tossed around. Had you toed the line, this case might have made your career. In my estimation, you have created far more trouble than you resolved.”\n"
"Taylor stands up, and you stand with her. Several burly suits step through the door behind you, flooding the room with light. The commissioner gives you a firm handshake, her eyes locked with yours. “The Foundation thanks you for your service. May we never meet again.”"

"你打斷她想為自己辯護，但調查官舉起一隻手阻止你。\n"
"“事實上，你該慶幸能這麼輕易的離開，如果照上面的意思，你會由於你魯莽的行動而草草的被處決，‘勾結’這個詞在會議中被提起了很多次。如果你更謹慎一些，這本來會是你新職位的完美開始。但依我評估，你解決的問題遠不及造成的麻煩多。\n"
"你跟著泰勒一起站起身，鏡子另一端的房間在許多模糊身影離開時被點亮。調查官正式的跟你握手，盯著你的雙眼說：“基石感謝你的付出。希望我們永遠不會再見面。”"
