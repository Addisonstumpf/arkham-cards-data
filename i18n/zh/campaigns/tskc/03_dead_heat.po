msgid "You are jolted awake by the sound of screeching wheels as your train shudders to a stop. Although it is barely morning, the heat from the sun rises in shimmering waves from the sweltering pavement to veil Marrakesh in an otherworldly glimmer. Your head pounds. The city wavers like a mirage in the middle of the Moroccan desert."
msgstr "你被火車減速的尖銳摩擦聲驚醒。儘管早晨才剛剛來臨，炙熱的太陽已經用熱浪為馬拉喀什蒙上了一片閃爍的面紗。整座城市看起來像摩洛哥沙漠中的海市蜃樓般搖曳著。"

"You meet your contact on the rooftop of a small cafe not far from the railway station. The man’s boyish frame is offset by a well-kempt grey beard that covers deep laugh lines. “You must be with the Foundation,” he extends a hand to shake. “I am Latif. Please, sit. You must be hungry.”\n"
"The table is laden with bowls and dishes heaped with eggs, olives, and rich cheese served with flat bread and hot atay. As you eat, Latif spreads a stack of newspapers on the table between you. “I don’t want to ruin your appetite, my friends, but there is some wicked purpose at work in the city.” He points out three different headlines:\n"
"<center><typewriter>MYSTERIOUS TOMB ROBBERY</typewriter></center>\n"
"<center><typewriter>SUDDEN BLIGHT DEVASTATES OLIVE GROVE</typewriter></center>\n"
"<center><typewriter>DOZENS MISSING IN MEDINA</typewriter></center>\n"
"A warm, pungent breeze wafts over you, rustling the newspaper. Latif whispers conspiratorially, “I assume you read the dossier. The one who calls herself Amaranth was seen here, and I believe she is responsible.” Looking over his shoulder, the middle-aged man produces a crisp photo of a beautiful 20-something woman in a black dress and matching gloves, a gaudy blossom tucked behind her ear.\n"
"“Just last night, I sent my contact to gather any information he could on her whereabouts. He hasn’t returned. I fear the worst,” Latif says, looking downcast. “But that is why you’re here, I suppose! The commissioner always sends such…” he looks at you as if considering his words. “Unique people.”\n"
"You assure Latif that you may be new to the Foundation, but that you are more than capable of handling the situation.\n"
"“I truly hope so,” says Latif, drinking deep from his cup of hot mint tea. “There is something strange happening here. My brother told me he saw our late grandfather walking the street in his burial shroud. I told him that he must have been dreaming, but I have heard similar stories. It is not safe to walk the streets at night anymore. I believe there is some terrible sorcery at work. Some unnatural influence. If only the Foundation did not redact their own missives!”\n"
"You spend the rest of the morning reviewing the bundle of newspapers and scrivenings Latif has collected. The first “tomb robbery” reported in the recent string of events was of Razin Farhi, a 16th-century philosopher and mathematician. “It is rumored that he was one of the founding members of the Red Coterie,” Latif tells you. Your mind races as you try to piece the information together: is Amaranth after another Key?\n"
"“Whatever is happening, we cannot afford to wait idly,” Latif says."

"你與聯絡人在離火車站不遠的一家咖啡廳頂樓見面。男人藏著微笑的灰色鬍子平衡了他稚氣的長相。“你一定是基石派來的。我叫拉提夫。請坐，你一定餓了。”他邊向你伸出手邊介紹。\n"
"桌上擺滿了裝滿蛋跟橄欖的碗，還有各式各樣的乳酪跟扁麵包，一旁放著一壺熱薄荷茶。當你用餐時，拉提夫將一疊報紙放到桌上。“我不想影響你的食慾，但邪惡的陰謀正在這個城市中進行。”他邊說邊指向三個不同的標題。\n"
"<center><typewriter>神秘盜墓行動</typewriter></center>\n"
"<center><typewriter>橄欖園無故枯萎</typewriter></center>\n"
"<center><typewriter>麥地那數十人失蹤</typewriter></center>\n"
"一陣炎熱刺人的微風拂過，吹亂了報紙。拉提夫低語著：“我想你已經讀過卷宗了。那名自稱永生花的女性在這裡，我認為她是始作俑者。”這位中年男子掃視一下四周後，拿出了一張脆弱的照片，上面是一個20多歲的美麗女性，穿著黑色洋裝跟黑色手套，耳邊戴著一朵艷麗的花朵。\n"
"“就在昨晚，我派了一個線人去蒐集關於她的情報。但他還沒回來，恐怕要做最壞的打算。”拉提夫低頭說到。“但我相信這就是你來到這的原因！調查官總是會派遣像你一樣……”他打量了你一下，思索著適當的用詞。“一樣特別的人來。”\n"
"你跟拉提夫保證，雖然你是新加入基石的人，但你絕對有能力處理這個事件。\n"
"“我衷心的期望。”拉提夫喝了一口熱薄荷茶。“這裡正發生奇怪的事，我弟弟說他看見我們過世的祖父身著壽衣在街上遊蕩，我說他一定是在作夢，但我聽到許多類似的故事。夜晚的街道已經不再安全了，有某種巫術正在流竄，一種不自然的力量。如果基石沒有刪改檔案就好了！”\n"
"你整個早上都在閱覽報紙跟聽取拉提夫蒐集的情資。一系列“盜墓案”中的第一件發生在拉金·法爾希的陵墓，一位16世紀的哲學家與數學家。拉提夫說：“有傳言說他是緋紅結社的創始成員之一。”你的思緒飛快的試著將所有情報拼湊起來：永生花是否在尋找另一個密鑰呢？\n"
"“無論眼下正在發生什麼，我們都必須立刻行動。”拉提夫說到。"

"There are no cabs to hail outside the railway station, so you walk to meet your contact on the rooftop of a near-empty cafe. The man who greets you has a boyish frame offset by a well-kempt beard that covers deep laugh lines. However, he is not smiling. “You’re late,” he says gravely. “I sent a telegram to the Foundation requesting assistance. We are in dire straits, as you say.”\n"
"You apologize and tell him you’ve done the best you can, and he rubs his brow worriedly. “I am sorry. It is good you are here, but I fear that things are set in motion already. Things we no longer have the time nor power to stop.” He gestures for you to sit. “I am Latif. Please. You will want to sit down for this.”\n"
"A spread of tempting local delicacies has been laid out on the table, but judging from the spare remnants, Latif ate most of it due to nerves. He shows you several newspapers in turn with headlines detailing desecrated tombs, dying crops, and numerous missing persons reports. As he relays these sobering events to you, you catch a scent of something foul on the wind. Looking out across the city, you see a pattern of inky black vines that run across building façades. At a distance, they look like raised veins on a dying body.\n"
"“My friend?” Latif’s voice breaks through your reverie. You apologize, and ask him about the vines. The middle-aged man sighs. “Yet another mystery, it seems. Last night, there was a great commotion outside Bahia Palace. Screaming and gnashing teeth. I sent one of my informants to investigate and he never returned. Soon after, the strange black blooms appeared, growing on every wall and surface. They stink of rot and produce awful, sharp thorns. I wouldn’t dare touch them.”\n"
"“Before this strange business began, my brother told me he saw our late grandfather walking the street in his burial shroud. I would have dismissed it but for the dozens of similar stories. There are now crowds of slow-moving, silent people walking the streets. Their eyes are empty, though their bellies are not,” Latif says bitterly, then drains the rest of his teacup.\n"
"“I believe the one who calls herself Amaranth is responsible. You might recognize her from the Foundation’s dossier. How helpful that they blot out the most important details in their own missives!” Latif produces a crisp photo of a beautiful 20-something woman in a black dress and matching gloves, a gaudy blossom tucked behind her ear.\n"
"“Another of my informants said he saw this ‘Amaranth’ at the Bahia Palace Gardens. Some strange work is afoot, and she is at the center of it. I say we go to the palace and put a stop to whatever awful plans she has in place, but be ready for anything.”\n"
"You catch a now-familiar scent of rot on the wind, and look down to the lip of the rooftop cafe. A single, black tendril has crept up the side of the building. At the end of the vine, a bulbous, black fruiting body has begun to develop. You aren’t sure if it is a trick of the late morning sun, or if there is some other strange process at work, but you could swear you see a shimmer of phosphorescent green flash along the body, and a noticeable movement, though there is no wind."

"你在火車站外招不到計程車，只好步行到一間空盪咖啡廳的頂樓與你的聯絡人會面。等待著你的是一名男性，他灰色的鬍子平衡了他稚氣的長相，但在他臉上看不見笑容。他嚴肅的說：“你來遲了，我發了電報給基石請求援助。如你所見，這裡情況非常不樂觀。”\n"
"你向他道歉並表示你已經盡快趕來了。他憂慮的搓揉著眼角：“我很抱歉，我很高興你來了，但恐怕情況已經失控了，我們已經沒有力量跟時間阻止了。”他示意要你入座。“我叫拉提夫，你會想坐下再聽的。”\n"
"桌子上放滿了當地傳統的佳餚，但就剩餘的情況來看，大部分都被焦慮的拉提夫吃掉了。他給了你幾份報紙頭條，內容關於被褻瀆的墓穴、枯死的作物跟失蹤的人口。當他將這些悲劇事件之間的關聯解釋給你聽時，你聞到風中飄來一股惡臭。你向外看向城市，墨汁般黑色的藤蔓爬滿了建築物的外牆，遠遠看去就像屍體上浮腫的血管。\n"
"“我的朋友？”拉提夫的聲音將你從出神狀態拉回現實。你向他道歉並問到那些藤蔓。這位中年男子嘆了口氣說：“這是另一個謎團，昨晚在巴西亞宮外有陣很大的騷動。尖叫聲跟咆嘯聲此起彼落，我派了人去查看，但他一去不回了。很快那些黑色的花就出現了，長滿了整座城市，散發著腐敗的惡臭，還長出尖銳的荊棘，我不敢碰觸它們。”\n"
"“在這個事件爆發前，我弟弟說他看見我們的祖父穿著壽衣在街上遊蕩，我本想忽略，但有越來越多的相似報告傳來。他們現在在街上沉默而緩慢的遊蕩，眼神空洞但飢餓無比。”拉提夫語帶苦澀，仰頭飲盡最後一點薄荷茶。\n"
"“我相信幕後黑手是自稱永生花的那名女性，你應該看過她的卷宗了，基石把所有最重要的地方抹除了可真是幫了大忙！”拉提夫拿出了一張脆弱的照片，上面是一個20多歲的漂亮女性，穿著黑色洋裝跟黑色手套，耳邊戴著一朵艷麗的花朵。\n"
"“我的另一個線人說他在巴西亞宮花園看到了‘永生花’，她就是這一團混亂的中心。我說我們直接衝進皇宮阻止她的計畫吧，但做好面對任何狀況的準備。”\n"
"你聞到一股熟悉的臭味，你從屋頂向下望，看見一小段黑色的蔓鬚已經爬上這棟建築了，在藤蔓的源頭有一顆黑色的花苞正在生長。你不確定是光線的關係還是真的有什麼超自然的力量，但你發誓花苞周圍有綠色的，如鬼火般的閃光正在移動，即使現在一點風都沒有。"

"A scent of smoke and decay greets you as you step off the train. You are one of just a handful of people to emerge onto the empty platform of the railway station. Black, dessicated vines climb up the sides of the surrounding buildings and end in riotous red flowers. An eerie silence hangs over everything.\n"
"On your way to meet your contact, you pass a few, scattered people who walk with a halting, awkward gait. Several of them reach out to you as you keep a wide berth, and you see their skin is jaundiced and dry, and their eyes have a hollow, empty look. A cloud of flies follows in their wake, buzzing incessantly. You are hardly surprised when you find the door to the cafe where you were supposed to meet a “Latif” boarded up.\n"
"Tarry death blooms on the walls and storefronts, all hastily barricaded. Fearful eyes peer out at you from between slatted boards. Marrakesh is in utter ruin. After wandering the city, you find the epicenter of the strange black vines lies in the pulverized remains of Bahia Palace. In the overgrown gardens, you find the remnants of a strange ritual, but no trace of those who conducted it."

"你踏出車廂的同時就聞到一股腐臭的煙味。空蕩蕩的月台上只有寥寥幾人，黑色乾枯的藤蔓爬滿周遭的建築物，妖豔的紅花卻盛放在藤蔓末端。詭異的寂靜籠罩著一切。\n"
"在你前往與聯絡人會面的路上，你經過幾名步履蹣跚、姿勢詭異的行人。有些人朝你靠近，你則試著保持距離，他們的皮膚不自然的泛黃且乾裂，惱人的蒼蠅在他們頭上盤旋。你終於找到了那間咖啡廳的大門，你應該要在頂樓跟一名叫做“拉提夫”的人會面。\n"
"代表死亡的花朵盛放在牆上跟門口。透過匆促用木板封死的門窗，你看到一雙雙充滿恐懼的眼睛，馬拉喀什已毀於一旦。你在巴西亞宮的遺址找到了那些黑色藤蔓的中心，在花園中你發現了施行儀式的痕跡，但罪魁禍首已不知去向。"
