"Following a set of coded directions from the Foundation, you follow a packed road to a small cafe in the heart of Lagos. Seated on a veranda overlooking a bustling market is Commissioner Taylor, nursing a glass filled with a deep red liquid. As you approach, she shuffles a deck of playing cards with one hand and looks up at you.\n"
"“You can clearly follow directions,” she says, gesturing for you to sit across from her. “But do you know how to play whist?” A warm breeze stirs the air as you take your seat and Taylor deals you each thirteen cards, then reveals the top of the deck: a one-eyed jack. “Now talk.” As you play, the commissioner asks you questions about your findings around the globe. As the final trump card is revealed, Taylor looks you dead in the eyes.\n"
"“We have identified thirteen members of the Coterie so far, but evidence suggests there are more. Far more. Even if we catch one, the organization will persist. And that’s to speak nothing of their many operatives and minions. It would be like trying to remove an anthill by catching individual ants.” You ask the commissioner what she is getting at and she lays down her last card with a smirk. “The way to bring them down is to cut them off at their source.”\n"
"You play your last card: a near loss. Taylor gathers the cards up. “I win this time, but I look forward to our next game,” she sips her drink. “Do not forget what I said. Find where they congregate.” As she speaks, a towering suit approaches from the side of the building and whispers in her ear. “I am sorry to cut this short, but I have business in Monaco. Unfortunately, I don’t have time to deliver these documents—see that these reach our operatives in Tokyo.”"

"你跟著基石一段加密訊息的指示走，走進一間在拉哥斯市中心繁忙街道上的咖啡廳。坐在陽台上俯視著熱鬧市場的人正是調查官泰勒。她拿著一杯裝著深紅色液體的玻璃杯，你走近時，她正用另一隻手洗著一副撲克牌。\n"
"“看來你很擅長跟從指示。”她邊說邊示意你坐在她對面。“那你也擅長玩惠斯特牌嗎？”一陣溫暖的微風吹來，泰勒發給你們一人13張牌，然後翻開牌庫第一張卡：是一張獨眼傑克。“現在，說吧。”你們進行遊戲的同時，調查官詢問你在世界各地調查的收穫。當最後一張王牌翻出時，她看著你的眼睛。\n"
"“我們已經取得13名結社成員的身份了，但有證據指出他們有更多成員，遠超這個數字。就算我們抓到一個，這個組織仍會繼續活動，對其他成員根本不會造成影響。就像想靠著抓一隻螞蟻來摧毀蟻丘一樣徒勞。”你詢問調查官她講這些的意思是什麼，她笑著打出最後一張卡：“唯一打倒他們的方法就是從根源動手。”\n"
"你打出最後一張卡：惜敗。泰勒將牌整理起來。“這次我贏了，但我期待下次對決。”她啜了一口飲料。“別忘了我說的，找出他們的核心。”當她說話時，一個高大的西裝男從另一邊走來，並在她耳邊說了些什麼。“我很抱歉要先結束這場會談，我得前往摩納哥處理事情。很遺憾我不能親自運送這份文件，請將它交給我們在東京的探員。”"

msgid "After putting into port, you find a warehouse marked with 39-0 and a logo of a red lion, per the instructions given to you by the Foundation. Once inside, you deliver Commissioner Taylor’s documents to a steely-eyed operative, who thanks you before melting into the shadows."
msgstr "你在港口下船後，跟隨指示找到一間標記39-0的倉庫，上面還有一個紅色獅子的圖案。你走進倉庫，將調查官泰勒的文件交給一名眼神堅毅的探員，他向你道謝後就消失在陰影之中。"
