msgid "A cool breeze greets you as you arrive in Perth. The capital of Western Australia is nestled in the crook of the Swan River, and despite—or perhaps because of—the nearby gold rush, it has the rugged feel of a frontier town. You catch a scent of something too sweet, possibly rotten, on the breeze."
msgstr "一陣冷風在你抵達伯斯時迎面吹來。這座澳洲西部的首府城市座落在斯旺河的環抱中，也許是因為附近的淘金潮，這裡有拓荒小鎮般的粗曠感。你在風中嗅到一個過於甜膩的氣味，似乎有什麼東西腐壞了。"

"You find Dr. Irawan at the local university cleaning up an empty lecture hall. On the blackboard is a precise chalk drawing of a stocky marsupial clutching a cluster of sedge grass.\n"
"“I did not expect to see you here,” the zoologist sets to erasing the blackboard. You ask about the sketch. “It is a rare species of quokka: the red-tailed quokka. They were first introduced to the West by Dutch explorers in the 17th century. And now no one—not even the Cambridge professor who taught me their name—remember what they are.”\n"
"“I do not know how much you have studied natural selection, but what we are experiencing feels very much like the introduction of a new apex predator into an ecosystem that has not evolved to withstand it,” says the zoologist. “Except that this predator feeds not only on the body, but on the actual existence of its prey. Although, of course, that would be unthinkable,” she laughs. “But I cannot help feeling that we are its prey. And the process is only accelerating.” The zoologist sits down and begins to flip idly through a sketchbook.\n"
"Thinking on the terms the Foundation used, you suggest she name the phenomena “Paranatural Selection.” She looks troubled at the suggestion, then smiles.\n"
"“I will be sure to credit you,” she says, then goes pale. You look down and see her gaze fixed on a particular page in her sketchbook. “This cannot be.”\n"
"You ask her what the matter is, and she points to the page. “Just yesterday, this page was not blank. The <i>Phalanger septimus</i>. A cuscus living in western New Guinea.”\n"
"Dr. Irawan begins gathering up her things. “I sketched this subject from direct observation just months ago. Perhaps there will be some trace of it—or of whatever force is behind all this—out in Manokwari.” She pushes a strand of hair behind her ear and smiles at you. “Thank you for listening. Perhaps we will meet again.”"

"你在當地的大學一間空蕩蕩的演講廳找到伊拉萬博士。黑板上用粉筆畫著一隻矮小，像是袋鼠的生物，前爪抓著一把莎草。\n"
"“沒想到會在這裡見到你。”那位動物學家起身擦去黑板上的圖畫。你詢問那個素描是什麼。“這是一個稀有的物種：紅尾矮袋鼠。牠們第一次被西方世界發現是在17世紀，由荷蘭的探險家發現。但現在所有人，包括在劍橋大學教會我牠們名字的教授，都失去了關於牠們的記憶。”\n"
"“我不確定你對物競天擇的學說了解多少，但我們現在面臨的情就如同一種新的頂級掠食者闖入一個還沒演化到能承受牠存在的生態系。更糟的是這個掠食者不只吞噬血肉，而是連同獵物的存在本身也一併抹去。雖然這假設實在是太荒唐了。”動物學家笑了起來。“但我還是不禁感覺我們也是牠的獵物之一。而這種狀況正在加速發生。”伊拉萬博士坐下，開始隨意的翻著她的素描本。\n"
"你想到基石的研究，建議她可以稱這個現象為“悖常天擇”。她思索了一下這個稱呼，然後微笑。\n"
"“我一定會標明這個詞的出處的。”她笑著說。然後她的臉色瞬間變白，你看見她的視線落在素描本上的某一頁。“這不可能啊。你問發生了什麼事，她指著那頁說：“它昨天還不是空白的，賽提米烏斯貂，一種生活在新幾內亞西部的袋貂。”\n"
"伊拉萬博士開始收拾東西。“我幾個月前才在直接目擊時畫下這份素描。也許在曼洛瓦里會有造成這一切元凶的線索。”她將一絲頭髮撥到耳後對你說：“感謝你的聆聽，也許我們會再見面。”"

msgid "Upon arriving in the city, you look for Dr. Irawan at the local university. A helpful professor scours the academic schedule on your behalf when you mention Dr. Irawan’s lecture, but finds nothing. You take out the card she gave you, but both sides are blank. It’s as though she has vanished completely…"
msgstr "你抵達城市後，前往當地的大學尋找伊拉萬博士。一位熱心的教授幫你在時程表上查詢伊拉萬博士的講座時間，但卻沒有任何記錄。你拿出她的名片，發現只剩下一片空白，就像是她完全消失了一樣……"

"You catch Dr. Irawan walking out of a lecture at the local university and invite her to a nearby cafe to chat about her research. On a sunlit veranda, she lays several life-like sketches out on the table between you. “Have you ever heard of the red-tailed quokka?” she asks. You shake your head. “They were first introduced to the West by Dutch explorers in the 17th century, and have been listed in standard taxonomy since then. I learned about them at Cambridge.”\n"
"Dr. Irawan leafs through a sketchbook to a blank page. “On a survey five years ago, I took several sketches in the wild. But recently, I opened my books and the sketches were blank, as if they had never been drawn. Moreover, every footnote and reference to them in academia has vanished. I asked my professor at Cambridge—the man who taught me what red-tailed quokkas were—and he looked at me as though I had gone mad.” The zoologist adjusts her large spectacles.\n"
"You assure Dr. Irawan that she is not mad, and share what little you can about the disappearances.\n"
"“I do not know how much you have studied natural selection, but what we are experiencing feels very much like the introduction of a new apex predator into an ecosystem that has not evolved to withstand it,” says the zoologist. “Except that this predator feeds not only on the body, but on the actual existence of its prey. Although, of course, that would be unthinkable,” she laughs. “But I cannot help feeling that we are its prey.”\n"
"Thinking on the terms the Foundation used, you suggest she name the phenomena “Paranatural Selection.” She looks troubled at the suggestion, then smiles.\n"
"“Perhaps I will use that, with your permission,” says Dr. Irawan. “I am glad we met. I was beginning to think this was all in my head.” She gives you her business card with the name of a hotel in Brazil written on the back. “I will be in Rio de Janeiro to continue my survey, and my next lecture. Perhaps I will see you there.”"

"伊拉萬博士在當地大學的講座結束時，你邀請她到附近的咖啡店討論她的研究。在陽光普照的露臺上，她拿出幾張栩栩如生的素描放到你們之間的桌上。“你有聽過紅尾矮袋鼠嗎？”她問到。你搖搖頭。“牠們第一次被西方世界發現是在17世紀，由荷蘭的探險家發現。之後就被列入物種列表中，我是在劍橋大學學到關於牠們的知識。”\n"
"伊拉萬博士翻到素描本中空白的一頁。“我在五年前的一次調查中畫了幾張牠們的素描。但最近我打開畫本時，卻是一片空白，就像我從來沒畫過牠們一樣。更糟糕的是，所有關於牠們的學術記錄跟筆記都消失了。我詢問劍橋的教授，就是當年教導我的那位教授，他居然像看瘋子一樣看著我。”這位動物學家推了推她的眼鏡。\n"
"你向伊拉萬博士保證她沒有瘋，並分享了一些你對於消失事件的所見所聞。\n"
"“我不確定你對物競天擇的學說了解多少，但我們現在面臨的情況就如同一種新的頂級掠食者闖入一個還沒演化到能承受牠存在的生態系。更糟的是這個掠食者不只吞噬血肉，而是連同獵物的存在本身也一併抹去。雖然這假設實在是太荒唐了。”動物學家笑了起來。“但我還是不禁感覺我們也是牠的獵物之一。”\n"
"你想到基石的研究，建議她可以稱這個現象為“悖常天擇”。她思索了一下這個稱呼，然後微笑。\n"
"“也許我會採用，如果你同意的話。”伊拉萬博士說。“很高興認識你，我差點開始以為這一切都是幻覺了。”她給了你一張名片，背後寫著一間巴西飯店的地址。“我會在里約熱內盧繼續研究跟準備下一次發表會，也許你可以到那跟我碰面。”"
