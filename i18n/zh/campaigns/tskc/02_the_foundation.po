"“Talk,” the woman commands.\n"
"“I’m a detective with the ICPC,” Flint barks back. “Flint, Li Flint. And you’re going to be in a lot of trouble when they hear about this.”\n"
"“I assure you, I will not. And you?” she asks, glaring in your direction. You explain that you are independent investigators working with Flint. She takes a moment to read your gaze—presumably to tell if you are lying. She, like Flint, seems low on trust. Finally, after a long, bated moment, she holsters her firearm. Flint’s hands drop to his sides. You let out a breath you didn’t know you were holding.\n"
"“We have been after that red-gloved man for quite some time. This is the first time we have gotten this close. He seems to have a knack for slipping away.” She nods to the two suits flanking her—a tall, athletic, pale-skinned woman and a sharp, clean-shaven man—and motions toward the walls. They keep a hand on their holsters as they scour the perimeter of the room.“And who is ‘we,’ exactly?” Inspector Flint asks. You’ve been wondering the very same thing. Your interrogator has a British accent, but she doesn’t seem to be part of any local outfit you’ve ever heard of.\n"
"She waits for confirmation from her two subordinates before continuing. “All clear, ma’am,” the man states. She sighs and crosses her arms. “All right. What I am about to tell you cannot leave this room under any circumstances. Am I clear?”\n"
"Flint shrugs. “Under penalty of what, exactly?”\n"
"“Summary execution,” she states without hesitation. Your throat closes tight. Even your partner flinches for a moment.\n"
"“Well then. I suppose we don’t have much of a choice, do we?” He glances at you. You nod; you might as well hear what she has to say.\n"
"“I am Commissioner Taylor, and these are agents Hudson and Antonova. We are with the <minicaps>Foundation</minicaps>, an international agency devoted to the discovery, research, and containment of objects with paradimensional capability.”\n"
"“What kind of baloney?” Flint practically laughs. But the woman who calls herself Taylor shows no sign of humor.\n"
"“After the Great War, many treaties and accords were signed. Paris. Versailles. But keeping the peace wasn’t the only goal. There were… oddities, you see. During the war. Things that did not add up. The Foundation’s purpose is to find these ‘things that do not add up’ and ensure that they cannot be used for such purposes ever again.”\n"
"“Well, this is a hell of a con you buttons have cooked up,” Flint says, but the darker tone in his voice indicates he doesn’t even believe himself. And you’re inclined to agree—the fact that Commissioner Taylor even knows of the Red-Gloved Man at all is proof that she has inside knowledge.\n"
"You decide that it’s more likely she is telling the truth than lying, and ask what she intends to do with you.\n"
"She paces in uncomfortable silence before finally letting out a sigh. “Well, I certainly can’t have your investigation running parallel to my own. And you might have information that could be pertinent to our work. So I say we work together.”\n"
"“Work together? Or work for you?” Flint asks pointedly, his eyes narrowing.\n"
"She allows herself a smile. “You are a clever man, I’ll give you that.” She nods to Agent Hudson, who produces several badges and hands them to you. “You’ll be your own cell of the Foundation, operating under our authority, but with independence. All you need to do is agree to report your findings to us.” She locks eyes with Flint appraisingly. “You’ll be our point of contact.”\n"
"You ask Taylor what you get out of the arrangement, besides the lifted threat on your lives. “We’ll hand over the intel we have on the organization the Red-Gloved Man works for and provide travel papers that can get you anywhere in the world, no questions asked, at no expense.”\n"
"Flint eyes the badge like one might an explosive, turning it over and over in his hands. “Two minutes ago you were pointing a gun at me, now you’re offering me a job?”\n"
"“Yes. Well? Are you in?”\n"
"You pull Flint aside to speak with him in private. The discussion is short and hushed, full of conjecture and paranoid theories about this “Foundation” and their true motives. But in the end, you decide to accept her offer. If it will help you get to the bottom of whatever is going on, it is the only real choice.\n"
"“Very well then,” Taylor explains. “The Red-Gloved Man is just one operative of his organization. Or, perhaps, its leader—that we are unable to determine. They call themselves the <minicaps>Red Coterie</minicaps>, so named due to the red garments they wear. They are after artifacts scattered across the world which possess paradimensional capabilities—the very same kind of objects we seek to find and contain. We call them Keys.”\n"
"You ask Commissioner Taylor what she means by the term paradimensional. “Imagine a cake with many layers,” she explains. “Everything we see and feel exists on one layer. But there are many more layers above and below ours. Something that is paradimensional exists on one layer, but draws energy from other, parallel layers. As a result, these Keys operate outside the laws of our dimension. Cause and effect. If left unchecked, they can be used to inflict terrible harm on the world. Our job—your new job—is to get them out of the hands of the Coterie and keep them secure in Foundation custody.”\n"
"If these Keys are as powerful as the Foundation believes, you agree that they should be kept in safe hands. But you cannot help but wonder what this has to do with the disappearances you’ve been investigating, if anything. Flint locks eyes with you and gives you the slightest shake of his head. He has no intention of telling them."

"“快說。”她命令你們。\n"
"“我是ICPC警探！”弗林特吼回去。“弗林特，李·弗林特。如果他們知道，妳就麻煩大了。”\n"
"“我跟你保證，我不會有麻煩的。那你呢？”她轉向你問道。你告訴她你是跟弗林特合作的獨立調查員。她看著你的眼睛——似乎在判斷你有沒有說謊。看來她跟弗林特一樣，不輕易信任他人。終於，在一段緊繃的時間後，她收回了武器。弗林特放下雙手，而你終於把偋住的一口氣吐了出來。\n"
"“我們追查那個紅手套的人很久了，這是我們第一次這麼接近。他似乎對逃走很有一套。”她對兩旁的人點點頭——一名高挑勻稱的白人女性，跟一名敏銳、沒蓄鬍的男性。他們依然將手握在槍上，開始四處搜尋並確保房間的安全。弗林特警探開口問：你說的‘我們’是誰？”你也在疑惑同樣的問題，你們的審問者有英國腔，但看起來卻不像任何你所知的在地組織。\n"
"“都安全了，女士。”等到她的兩名同伴確認周邊安全後她才再度開口。她抱著胸嘆了口氣：“好吧，我接下來說的事情必須保密，懂了嗎？”\n"
"弗林特聳聳肩問到：“不然怎樣？”\n"
"“處決。”她毫不猶豫的說。你感覺喉嚨縮了一下，就連弗林特都有瞬間畏縮了。\n"
"弗林特看了你一眼：“看來我們沒什麼選擇了對吧？”你點頭同意，你也想知道她會說什麼。\n"
"“我是調查官泰勒，這是韓德森探員跟安東諾娃探員。我們是<b>基石</b>的一員。我們的組織致力於發現、研究跟控管世界各地擁有超次元力量的物品。”\n"
"“是在扯哪一種蛋？”弗林特幾乎笑出來。但那個自稱泰勒的女人完全不覺得有趣。\n"
"“在戰爭結束後，簽署了很多和約跟協定，巴黎和約、凡爾賽條約。但維持和平不是唯一的目的。有許多……如你所見，奇怪的事情發生。戰爭中有很多奇異事件無法解釋。基石的目的就是調查這些無法解釋的事件，並確保它們不會再度發生。\n"
"“好吧，這一切聽起來像是你們腦袋壞掉了。”弗林特回答。但他的聲音中沮喪的語調透露出他自己都不相信自己。你也傾向同意——調查官泰勒認識紅手套，代表她知道的比你們更多。\n"
"你認為她說的的應該是實話，並詢問她對你們有什麼打算。\n"
"她踱著步，經過一段令人不適的沉默後，她開口：“我不能讓你們的調查干擾到我。而且你們也許有對我們有幫助的資訊。所以我建議我們一起行動。”\n"
"弗林特瞇著眼尖銳的問道：“一起行動?還是為妳做事?”\n"
"她露出一絲微笑，“我得承認你是個聰明人。”她示意韓德森探員，韓德森交給你們兩個徽章。她邊打量著弗林特邊說：“用這個可以跟基石聯絡，你們可以獨立行動，但要在我們的監管下。你們只要同意將得到的情報跟我們報告。你們會成為我們的聯絡人。”\n"
"你問泰勒你們能得到什麼援助，除了威脅以外。“我們會提供關於紅手套組織的情報，還有讓你們能前往世界各地的證件文書，不問原因、無須代價。”\n"
"弗林特用看炸彈的眼神盯著徽章，將它在手裡翻來覆去。“兩分鐘前你才拿槍指著我，現在卻要我幫你工作？”\n"
"“是，沒錯。所以？你要加入嗎？”\n"
"你將弗林特拉到一邊。經過一番短暫但激烈的討論，你們質疑“基石”這個組織的真實性跟動機，但最後你們還是決定接受她的要求。如果這能帶領你們找到真相，那你們也別無選擇。\n"
"“非常好。”泰勒接著解釋道：“紅手套只是他的組織中其中一名成員，也許可能是領袖，我們並不確定。他們自稱<b>緋紅結社</b>，源於他們穿的紅色服飾。他們的目標是散落在世界各地具有超次元力量的物品，像是我們找尋並控管的那些。我們稱這些物品為密鑰。”\n"
"你問調查官泰勒超次元是什麼意思。她解釋道：“想像一個很多層的蛋糕。我們能看到跟感受到在其中一層的東西，但在我們之上與之下還有許多層次。具有超次元力量的物品可以從其他平行層汲取力量，也就是說這些密鑰在啟動並造成影響時，無須遵從我們這個次元的法則。如果放任不管，它們可能會被用來對這個世界造成巨大的傷害。我們的工作——你們的新工作，是將它們置於基石安全的保管之下，免於落入結社的手中。”\n"
"如果這些密鑰如同基石所說的一樣危險，那必須讓它們保管在對的人手上。但你不禁想知道這跟你在調查的失蹤事件有什麼關聯。弗林特盯著你並微微地揮了揮手，看來他不希望告知他們這件事。"

"You decide it’s best to tell Commissioner Taylor why you were looking into the Red-Gloved Man to begin with. Flint lets out an audible sigh. She mulls it over for a few moments, then shakes her head. “That is something to look into, but your primary objective is to acquire the Keys the Coterie is searching for, at all costs. Am I understood?” Taylor further explains that she will forward any relevant information to Flint’s office, with some “sensitive details” omitted, of course. She will also provide the ICPC with the requisite papers regarding Flint’s new “position.”\n"
"“Oh, and Agent Flint,” she says on her way out, addressing him by his new title. “Your cell may have the independence to act on their own accord, but do not forget that you report directly to me. I expect you to do so without reservation should you discover anything of import.”\n"

"你覺得最好告訴調查官泰勒你一開始會來追查紅手套的原因。弗林特明顯的嘆了口氣。她仔細思考了一下後搖了搖頭。“這的確需要深入調查。但你們目前的首要目標是不計代價阻止結社拿到密鑰，清楚了嗎？”接著泰勒說她會告知國際刑警協會相關的資訊，當然會省略一些“敏感的細節”。她也會準備好要將弗林特轉調到“新單位”的文件給ICPC。\n"

"The next morning, your “cell” meets at the tea room near Trafalgar Square where you had originally intended to meet the previous night. Together, you go over the documentation provided to Flint by this “Foundation.”\n"
"“It’s all a bit difficult to believe, if I’m being honest,” Flint says, “but everything checks out. The travel papers, the job transfer, all of it. Not even my boss questioned it for a moment. I guess we’re secret agents now, eh?”\n"
"You agree; unbelievable as it might seem, it’s no less strange than the matters you had already been looking into. “Right. Well, I think the best thing to do is to split up. Shanghai is where I grew up. I have connections there I can leverage. So I’ll head there first. Where you want to investigate next is up to you. Meet up with me later, and we can figure out where to go from there.”"

"你表示同意，雖然看起來很神奇，但跟你們調查的事件相比也沒這麼難以理解。“看來我們最好分頭進行，我要先去上海，我在那裡長大，有可用的線人。你可以自行決定要去哪裡。我們之後再會合，看下一步該怎麼做。”"

Each space on the map is connected to one or more other spaces by paths. When you are ready to embark, travel along the paths to reach whichever destination you wish (as a group). For each path you use to reach your destination, you must mark 1 <b>time</b> in your Campaign Log (to a minimum of 1).\n"
"At each space on the map, there is a number and letter combination that will guide you to a particular page in this Campaign Guide. You do not have to stop at every space you travel through; however, if you wish to stop traveling and see what is at that space, turn to the page of the Campaign Guide that matches the indicated number and follow the story text there. This might lead you to an interlude or to a scenario. There is no perfect path to follow, so follow your gut… just be wary of how much time you spend (see “Tracking Time” in Campaign Setup).\n"
