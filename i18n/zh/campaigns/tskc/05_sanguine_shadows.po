"As soon as you arrive in Buenos Aires, you set your meeting with Oficial Bolívar at a café overlooking the harbor. Seagulls cry out over the many shipping and fishing boats in the distance. Even after Bolívar arrives, you continue to keep an eye out for others listening in—for anyone wearing red, especially. The officer meets you in uniform instead of casual clothes—whether by protocol or due to being overworked, you are unsure. His response to your letter seemed overly eager. Perhaps he is as starved for information regarding his target as you are? “Your letter suggested we may be able to aid one another,” he says casually, after calling out for a café chico. “You have information regarding La Chica Roja?”\n"
"You clarify that you are the one seeking information from Bolívar, not the other way around. “Well, scratch my back and I’ll scratch yours,” he says, his expression turning serious. “What do you know?”"
msgstr ""
"抵達布宜諾斯艾利斯後你立即安排與玻利瓦督察見面。你們約在港邊的一間咖啡廳會面，海鷗在天空鳴叫，遙遙可見許多漁船與商船來來往往。即使在玻利瓦走進店門後，你也依然注意著周遭的人，尤其是那些身著紅色衣物的人。督察穿著制服前來，你不確定是出於規定還是他正在工作。他對你信件的回應顯得有點過於積極，也許他跟你一樣極需更多關於目標的情報？他點了一小杯咖啡後一派輕鬆地說道：“你的信中說我們可以互相幫助，你有紅姑娘的情報？”\n"
"你表示是你要向玻利瓦詢問情報，而不是反過來。他的表情變得嚴肅：“你幫我，我就會幫你。所以，你知道些什麼？“"

msgid "Tell Bolívar everything regarding the target."
msgstr "告訴玻利瓦所有情報。"

msgid "Give Bolívar some breadcrumbs."
msgstr "告訴玻利瓦部分情報。"

msgid "Insist that Bolívar tells you what he knows."
msgstr "堅持要玻利瓦先透漏情報。"

msgid ""
"You decide that honesty is the best policy. You doubt he would believe your tale about extraterrestrials and secret organizations, but you can at least tell him what you know regarding “La Chica Roja.” He mulls over the information you give him, taking a minute to process everything. “Hmm… so you really believe that La Chica Roja has these… abilities…?” You tell him you are certain. It may be tough to believe, but it is important that Bolívar understand the reality of the situation. “I knew it. I knew it!” he grins. “Of course! It makes so much sense. The way she would vanish into thin air, move with such speed…” You hadn’t expected him to believe you, but it turns out your information has only confirmed his own suspicions. “So how do you intend to help us catch her?”\n"
"You tell Bolívar that you intend to capture her on your own. All you need from him is information regarding her objective and last known whereabouts in Buenos Aires. He pulls several photos of buildings in Buenos Aires out of his folder and reveals them to you. “La Chica Roja has carved a path of thievery and mischief throughout Buenos Aires. Hundreds of thousands of pesos in stolen art and artifacts.” He points to each of the photos, one by one. “Casa Rosada, Palacio Errázuriz, Teatro Colón. She has been spotted many times, but try as we might, we cannot catch her in the act. Those in charge are, shall we say…unhappy… with how the situation has been handled.” He looks away and scratches at the back of his hand as he stammers. It is clear to you that Bolívar’s career is on the line. But you know the stakes are much higher than even that. “It is like she is toying with us. Mocking us.” He strikes the surface of the table in frustration. “Making a killing while making fools of us all.”"

"你認為展現誠信才是上上之策。也許他不會相信背後有一些無國界的秘密組織在運作，但至少可以告訴他有關“紅姑娘”的部分。他吸收著你告知的資訊，花了幾分鐘整理思緒。“嗯……所以你真的相信她有某種……力量？”你表示你很肯定，雖然可能很難接受，但更重要的是讓玻利瓦認清現實。“我就知道！”他嘴角咧起。“她當然有！現在一切都合理多了，為什麼她可以憑空消失，還可以用那種速度移動……。“你沒意料到他會相信你，但你的情報似乎是證實了他長久以來的猜測。“所以，你要怎麼幫助我們逮到她？”\n"
"你對玻利瓦表示你打算獨力抓到她，你只需要她在布宜諾斯艾利斯活動地點的情報。玻利瓦從檔案夾中抽出幾張照片給你。“紅姑娘在布宜諾斯艾利斯一路作案搗亂，無數價值連城的畫作與藝術品失竊。”他指著一張一張的照片說：“玫瑰宮、埃拉蘇里宮、哥倫布劇院。她被目擊到許多次，但不管我們怎麼嘗試都無法在她作案時逮到她。上級們對這個狀況非常……不滿意。”他撇開目光，邊抓撓自己的手背邊心虛的說。顯然玻利瓦的職涯岌岌可危，但這件事牽扯的遠不止他個人的事業。“她就像是在玩弄我們、嘲笑我們。”玻利瓦挫折的捶著桌子。“把我們當笨蛋耍，我們最後都會被她害死。”"

msgid "If an investigator has the [[Criminal]] trait:"
msgstr "如果有[[罪犯]]屬性的調查員："

msgid "You of all people know better than to presume the target’s intent from so little. Had she intended to sell the stolen relics, there would be evidence of such sales on the black market. She would likely make as much or more ransoming the goods back to their owners. Besides, you doubt the Coterie is after mere wealth. There must be some other value to the stolen items."
msgstr "在線索如此稀少的狀況下，你比任何人都還清楚要從何處著手。如果她想要脫手這些贓物，那在黑市裡一定有跡可循，在黑市交易會比要求原主贖回贓物還賺得更多。但是你懷疑結社不可能只是純粹追求財富，這些失竊的物品一定有其他方面的價值。"

msgid "You tell Oficial Bolívar that you will help him find the Girl in the Carmine Coat, but only if he aids you in your investigation. “Of course,” he says with a grin. “If it means we can finally put that thief behind bars, I will do what I can.” You shake the man’s hand and together, a plan begins to brew."
msgstr "你向玻利瓦督察表示你會協助他們抓到紅大衣女孩，但他們必須也協助你的調查。“這是當然的。”他爽快的答應。“只要能逮到那個小賊，我會盡我所能。”你們握了握手，開始制定計畫。"

"For the sake of diplomacy, you decide to give Bolívar a few harmless bits of information regarding “La Chica Roja,” but nothing more. You can’t risk the truth of the situation getting out. Better that the police think of the Girl in the Carmine Coat as only an extraordinarily skilled thief, and nothing more. “That is all you know?” he asks, incredulous. “And here I thought that you being here meant… Oh well. I suppose she really is a mystery, after all. So how do you intend to help us catch her?”\n"
"You tell Bolívar that you intend to capture her on your own. All you need from him is information regarding her objective and last known whereabouts in Buenos Aires.

It is clear to you that Bolívar’s career is on the line. But you know the stakes are much higher than that. “She is toying with us. She will toy with you too. Chew your investigation up and spit you out.”\n"
"You assure Oficial Bolívar that you can catch her, but it’s better if his team stays out of your way. “If it means putting that thief behind bars, I will let you have a go at it,” he agrees. You shake the man’s hand, and a plan begins to brew.\n"

"為了避免外交上的麻煩，你決定只告訴玻利瓦一部分“紅姑娘”的情報，你不能冒險將事情複雜化。最好讓警方認為紅大衣女孩只是個技巧高超的神偷就好。“你知道的就只有這樣？”玻利瓦無法置信。“我以為你來到這裡是代表……算了，她是真的非常神秘。所以你打算如何幫助我們逮到她？”\n"
"你對玻利瓦表示你打算獨力抓到她，你只需要她在布宜諾斯艾利斯活動地點的情報。玻利瓦從檔案夾中抽出幾張照片給你。“紅姑娘在布宜諾斯艾利斯一路作案搗亂，無數價值連城的畫作與藝術品失竊。“他指著一張一張的照片說：“玫瑰宮、埃拉蘇里宮、哥倫布劇院。她被目擊到許多次，但不管我們怎麼嘗試都無法在她作案時逮到她。上級們對這個狀況非常……不滿意。”他撇開目光，邊抓撓自己的手背邊心虛的說。顯然玻利瓦的職涯岌岌可危，但這件事牽扯的遠不止他個人的事業。“她在玩弄我們，你也會被她耍的團團轉，她會把你的調查像嚼口香糖一樣，嚼膩了就吐掉。”\n"
"你向玻利瓦督察保證你一定會抓到她”但建議他的團隊不要涉入。“只要能逮到那個小賊”我會盡我所能。”他同意了。你們握了握手，你開始制定計畫。\n"

"You shake your head. This isn’t a negotiation—you cannot let Oficial Bolívar and his investigation impede yours in any way. “And what makes you think I am going to cooperate if you refuse to assist?”\n"
"You pull out one of the letters given to you by Agent Taylor and hand it to Bolívar. He opens it slowly and warily, keeping his eyes on you the entire time. It takes him little time to read through the entire thing, after which he crumples it up and tosses it back onto the table. “Damn you,” he says. You ask him once more what he knows regarding the target’s objective and last known whereabouts. He pulls several photos of buildings in Buenos Aires out of his folder and tosses them onto the table. “La Chica Roja has carved a path of thievery and mischief throughout Buenos Aires. Hundreds of thousands of pesos in stolen art and artifacts.” He points to each of the photos, one by one. “Casa Rosada, Palacio Errázuriz, Banco de la Provincia. She has been spotted many times, but try as we might, we cannot catch her in the act. And now here you are, complicating the whole ordeal.”\n"
"You examine the photos, ignoring Bolívar’s annoyed glare. It’s obvious that his career is on the line, but you cannot let the frustration of one man get in the way of your investigation. If the police get to the Girl in the Carmine Coat before you do, the best case scenario is that it will be tougher for you to get the information you need from her. Worst case scenario, it will only put them all in danger. Better for you to be the one to confront her.\n"
"You tell Oficial Bolívar that his team is to stay out of your way while you conduct your own investigation. Furthermore, you must be the one to question her if she is taken into custody—not the police. He lets out a sigh and shakes his head. “Do what you’re gonna do. Won’t be my head on the chopping block this time.” You get the feeling that Bolívar doesn’t think you can pull this off, but unlike him, you understand what you’re truly up against… though you still don’t know why. You take his documents and begin to brew a plan."

"你搖頭拒絕，你不是來被審問的。不能讓玻利瓦督察妨礙你。你對他說：“你為什麼會認為在你不願提供協助的狀況下，我還會跟你合作？”\n"
"你拿出調查官泰勒給你的信交給玻利瓦。他一邊懷疑的盯著你，一邊緩慢的將信抽出來。他花了一點時間看完內容，然後將它揉爛丟在桌上。“去你的。”你再度要求他提供目標的情報跟最後目擊的地點。他從檔案夾中抽出幾張布宜諾斯艾利斯建築的照片、將它們丟在桌上。“紅姑娘在布宜諾斯艾利斯一路作案搗亂，無數價值連城的畫作與藝術品失竊。“他指著一張一張的照片說：“玫瑰宮、埃拉蘇里宮、省立銀行。她被目擊到許多次，但不管我們怎麼嘗試都無法在她作案時逮到她。而現在你又來攪局，把一切弄得更複雜。”\n"
"你忽略玻利瓦控訴的目光，逕自研究著照片。顯然玻利瓦的職涯岌岌可危，但你不能讓這位挫折的警官介入你的調查。如果警方先逮到紅大衣女孩，把你之後的行動變的更加困難已經是最好的情況了；最糟的情況是他們都將置於危險之中。最好還是由你獨自與她接觸。\n"
"你告訴玻利瓦督察在你進行調查時不要妨礙到你。而且如果成功抓到紅大衣女孩，你必須是第一個訊問她的人，而不是警方。玻利瓦嘆了口氣，搖了搖頭：“隨便你，反正這次不是我要上斷頭台了。”你知道他並不覺得你能成功，但你與他不同，雖然還不清楚紅大衣女孩的動機，但你很清楚自己真正面對的是誰。你拿走了檔案然後開始制定計畫。"

But if that’s truly the case, then who do you work for?” she asks. “You know what, nevermind that. You seem to know who I work for, don’t you? Well then, surely you must know there are two of us operating in Buenos Aires. Why aren’t you after the other guy?”\n"

You, my friend, have outdated information.” You ask if she is using the stolen art pieces to assemble a Key, as the Foundation’s intel suggested. “Key? Oh, I see. You call them ‘Keys.’ Well, yes, that much is true. But you’re missing the why.”\n"
"The Girl in the Carmine Coat paces through the room, stepping in and out of countless shadows. “The other guy. ‘The Sanguine Watcher,’ they call him. Nobody knows his real name.” She takes off her hat and runs her finger along its scarlet hatband before using it to mask her countenance. “Just like me, I guess. Nameless. Faceless.” Then she rolls it back onto her head with a chuckle. “Only, el observador sanguinario ain’t like me. He’s already got his hands on more than a few pieces. Even with just those, he’ll use it only out of cruelty and malice. Human experimentation. Spellcraft. Real creepy stuff. He gets the rest of ‘em, who knows what he’ll do with them. My associates tend to thrive on that kind of thing. But not me.” Her fierce brown eyes lock with yours, soft and steely all at once. “I came here to stop him.”"

"紅大衣女孩在房間中踱步，在陰影間若隱若現。“另一個傢伙，他們叫他‘訕笑監視者’，沒人知道他的真實身分。”紅姑娘脱下帽子，用手指勾住帽帶並用它遮住自己的臉。“跟我一樣，沒有名字、沒人認得。”她輕聲一笑，將帽子帶回頭上。“只是，監視者先生不喜歡我。他已經取得好幾片碎片了，他將它們用在殘忍、惡毒的用途上：人體實驗、邪惡魔法之類的可怕用途。如果他拿到剩下的碎片，天知道他還會做出什麼事，我的同志似乎很熱衷於傷害他人。”她熾烈的棕色眼睛與你四目相對，眼中同時流露出柔和與決心。“但我不一樣，我是來阻止他的。”"

The darkness peels back, revealing a scarlet-red sky. “His mark. Been keeping it hidden for a while now so nobody panics.

msgid "You rush to apprehend your quarry, but with a twirl of shadows, she has vanished. It is as if she was a trick of the light all along—the same kind of mischief mirrored in Oficial Bolívar’s reports. Thankfully, you now possess enough of what she was after to put it together yourself. It takes some time and research, but eventually you are able to slot the various pieces of what you originally assumed to be art together. To your surprise, the result is an ornate figurine of a woman in robes. Tears, carved as thin lines like bloody scars, trail down the figure’s cheeks. With your new prize in tow, you report back to Oficial Bolívar the next day. He is more than a little miffed that his enemy escaped his grasp, but relieved that her campaign of thievery is finally at an end. “I warned you she would get away,” he says between sips of his espresso. “As far as my superiors are concerned, the book is closed on this one. Won’t look good on my record, but as long as she’s fled the city like you say, I am content with that.” You thank him again for his help and prepare to leave Buenos Aires behind."
msgstr "你向前一撲想要抓住目標，但她隨著一道旋轉的陰影消失了。就好像她的存在只是某種光影的把戲，跟你在玻利瓦督察報告中看到的一樣。慶幸的是你已經獲得了足夠的部件，能夠組合起她在找尋的東西。你很驚訝成品是一個身著長袍的精美女性雕像，鮮紅的眼淚像傷疤一般劃過她的臉頰。隔天你帶著你的戰利品向玻利瓦督察回報，他有點不高興他的敵人從他指縫間溜走了，但又對這一連串竊案終於結束感到鬆了口氣。“我警告過你她會成功逃走吧。”他邊啜飲著咖啡邊說，“至少就我的長官們關注的問題來說，這件案子算是結束了。雖然我的記錄不會太好看，但如果她真像你說的離開了城市，那我也就滿意了。”你再次感謝他提供的協助，然後準備離開布宜諾斯艾利斯。"

msgid "Your erstwhile adversary watches in grim silence as her rival is safely borne aloft on wings of darkness. “Damned things,” she spits. “They’ll follow whoever whistles loudest, I guess.” You ponder aloud what this means for the two of you. With the Sanguine Watcher out of the way, you wonder if she will keep her word. To your relief, she smirks and hands you the remaining pieces of the Key you’d both been competing for. “This is what you’re really after, isn’t it? Here. My main goal was only making sure that ojete en una nube de pedos didn’t get his hands on it. I trust it in your hands.” She then shows you how to fit the various pieces together and, to your surprise, the result is an ornate figurine of a woman in robes. Tears, carved as thin lines like bloody scars, trail down the figure’s cheeks. “The Rubicund Statuette,” she reveals, “also known as the Weeping Lady.” You ask what she will do now, and she responds with a tip of her hat. “Oh, I’ll be around. You helped me out back there. Don’t worry. I’ll pay you back.” With a twirl of her coat, she is gone."
msgstr "你的舊敵人冷眼看著她的對手被黑色的雙翼帶上天空。“該死的玩意兒，”她啐了一口：“我猜誰口哨吹得最大聲，牠們就聽誰的。”你思考著現在的狀況代表著什麼，現在監視者逃了，她還會遵守承諾嗎？你在她將剩下的密鑰碎片交給你時鬆了口氣。“這才是你真正的目標對吧？拿去吧，我的目的只是確保那個渾身發臭的混蛋得不到它而已。我相信交到你手中會更好。”接著她教你如何將不同的碎片結合起來，你很驚訝成品是一個身著長袍的精美女性雕像，鮮紅的眼淚像傷疤一般劃過她的臉頰。“鮮紅雕像，”她說到，“又叫做泣血女士。”你問她接下來有什麼打算。她點了點帽子說：“喔，我會罩著你的。你幫了我，別擔心，我會回報你的。”隨即她一旋大衣消失了。"

msgid "Oficial Bolívar was right: the Girl in the Carmine Coat chewed your investigation up and spat you out. You meet with him the next day, and the air is one of deadened frustration. “I warned you, did I not?” He says between sips of an espresso that looks and smells about as dark and bitter as his mood. “This puts me in a precarious position. La Chica Roja has gone to ground, from what we can tell. As far as my superiors are concerned, the book is closed on this one. I cannot help you any further.” He groans. “If I even still have a job when this is all over.” You give Oficial Bolívar your assurances that you did all you could to catch the thief, but he waves you off. “Oh, I am sure. Does not matter now, does it? What is done is done. I give up. She wins.” You thank him again and prepare to leave Buenos Aires behind."
msgstr "玻利瓦督察是對的，紅大衣女孩的確把你玩弄於股掌之間。你隔天與玻利瓦見面，挫折的氣氛讓空氣一片死寂。“我警告過你，沒錯吧？”他邊啜飲著咖啡邊說，心情跟手中的咖啡一樣黑暗且苦澀。“我現在的處境岌岌可危，據我們所知，紅姑娘似乎收手了。對於我的長官們來說，這件案子算是結束了，所以我無法再提供你任何協助。”他嘟噥著說。“我連這一切結束後我還能不能保住工作都不知道。”你向玻利瓦督察保證你已盡了全力抓捕這個小偷，但他只是揮揮手說：“哦，我相信你，但有沒有都沒差了對吧？木已成舟，我放棄，她赢了。”你再次感謝他提供的協助，然後準備離開布宜諾斯艾利斯。"
