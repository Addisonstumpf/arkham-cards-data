msgstr "斯德哥爾摩"

msgid "The docks bustle with activity as you arrive in Stockholm. Towering dock workers load massive crates of silvery, flapping fish into trucks as morning chimes ring in the cool clear air. With several days until your next departure, you seize upon the opportunity to explore the city’s eclectic culture. Advertisements for a production of a play named “Ödestimmen” paper the alleys and stops surrounding Stockholm’s largest theatre. You follow the cobblestone streets around Stockholm’s old town district, which the locals tell you is called “the town between bridges.” The winding narrow paths loop in on themselves and cross at odd angles to form a labyrinth of crumbled mustard-yellow alleys and worn façades. You pass a row of distinctly painted rowhouses overlooking the town square. As you sit down and watch locals come and go, you feel a great weight lift from you, if only for a moment. The broad blue sky overhead is clear and cloudless, and the hubbub around you is strangely calming."
msgstr "你在斯德哥爾摩繁忙的港口下船。在冰冷清澈的晨間空氣中，高大的碼頭工人正將一箱箱裝滿鮮活跳動的銀色漁獲裝載到貨車上。離你下一次啟程還有幾天，你決定把握時間體驗這座城市獨特的文化。在城內最大戲院的街上到處都貼滿一齣名叫“命運之聲”戲劇的廣告。你沿著鵝卵石街道步行到斯德哥爾摩的舊城區，當地人稱呼那裡為“橋梁間的小鎮”。起風的窄巷以奇怪的角度互相糾纏，形成一個由老舊店面跟斑駁黃色牆壁形成的迷宮。你走過一排五顏六色的房屋，向下俯視著小鎮的廣場。你坐在路邊，看著當地人來來去去，在這個瞬間，你感覺肩上的重擔稍微減輕了一些。頭頂湛藍廣闊的天空晴朗無雲，熙熙攘攘的人聲讓你感到意外的平靜。"

msgid "As you walk down Shoemaker’s street, you pass a familiar sight. Looking up, you see a narrow building with a slate façade, wide black windows, and unsettling accents. You have the distinct feeling you have been here before. You stand still for a moment as others pass you in the narrow alley, until you remember the same building in Bombay. If not for the distinct, black windows and the harsh lines, you might not have remembered it. As you scan the façade, the frieze overhanging the door stands out to you. Where there were various recognizable figures before, you see odd, gangling facsimiles. The features are almost plastic; the smiles are too broad; the eyes seem to bulge. The number 13 is carved next to the door, same as in Bombay. Curious, you step up and turn the doorknob, but it doesn’t budge. Knocking on the door produces virtually no sound. Although it looks like wood, it feels solid as concrete. Stopping a passer-by, you ask how long the building has been here. “What do you mean? This is a very old city. It’s always been here,” they tell you. You find yourself questioning if the original you saw was even the original: how many other houses look just like this one in how many other cities? The building grows more foreboding the longer you look at it. A shudder courses up your spine, and you decide to leave the building alone."
msgstr "你走在鞋匠街上時，看見一個熟悉的景象，你抬頭看見一棟狹窄的建物，門上有石板裝飾，窗戶一片漆黑，散發著令人不安的氣息。你之前有過這種奇怪的感覺，你佇立了一陣子後才回想起孟買的那棟建築。如果不是看見漆黑的窗戶跟獨特的銳利線條，你可能無法回想起來。你檢視著建築，門上的石板吸引了你的注意力，你認出幾個跟另一個建築不同的符號，你看見奇怪、高瘦的人形，但樣子非常不自然，嘴咧的太寬、眼睛也過於突出。門上的號碼與孟買相同，都是13。你好奇的上前轉動門把，但它紋絲不動。你試著敲門，卻幾乎沒發出聲音，雖然門的材質看起來像木頭，摸起來卻像水泥一般堅硬。你詢問路人這座建築是什麼時候建成的。他們說：“什麼意思？這是座古老的城市，它一直都在阿。”你疑惑著之前看到的那座建築是否是原版的，又有多少城市中有類似的建築？你看著建築越久，不祥的感覺就越強，你打了個冷顫後離開了，決定不要跟它有更多牽扯。"

msgid "As you walk down Shoemaker’s street, one façade in particular stands out to you. A narrow building with handsome cornice molding and intricate stonework is wedged between two older local buildings. The number 13 is carved next to a pair of austere wooden doors. Over the door is a slate frieze that depicts a cast of mythological figures: some recognizable, some not. The building itself looks out of place amidst the worn stone and crumbling history of the surrounding alleyway. The look of the building makes you feel vaguely uneasy the longer you study it. There is a coldness, a sharpness to the building’s design, accentuated by jagged quoins and harsh angles. Something about the wide, black windows, the dark interior, denotes the emptiness of a hollow skull. The alley around you, too, is strangely quiet: passers-by do not seem to linger here."
msgstr "你走在斯德哥爾摩的街道上時，一棟狹窄的建物吸引了你的注意力。它的屋簷上有精美的裝飾，還有精湛的石雕工藝，讓它與兩邊老舊的建築顯得截然不同。簡樸的木製大門上刻著數字13，門上方有一塊石板，上面刻著各種神話中的符號與形狀，有些你認識；有些無法辨認。這座建築與巷道中老舊破損的歷史建築相比顯得格格不入。不適的感覺在你檢視建築時逐漸增長，建築本身的設計有種冷酷、尖銳的感覺，銳利的牆角跟線條更加強了這種印象。漆黑的大面窗戶跟其中的黑暗就像骷髏的雙眼一般空洞而詭異。四周的巷道安靜的很不自然，看來行人們都不願在此逗留。"
