"A chill breeze flutters through the streets of Kathmandu, along with a faint, shrill whine. To the north, the Himalayas loom over the city, only their peaks illuminated by the westward sun. Pinks and purples bathe the sky in vibrant beauty. You could stare at such a breathtaking sight forever… but you have a job to do. Despite the quiet, peaceful evening, that soft, sharp piping does not cease, like an aching sense of dread in the back of your mind. As the evening drags on and the whistling grows louder, you realize you are the only one who can hear the strange sound. It feels as though it is reaching out to you directly. As if it hears you, too. As if it knows you. On a whim, you close your eyes and strain yourself to listen closer. It’s difficult to tell where exactly the sound is coming from—it seems to waft all around you and echo throughout the streets—but it grows in volume as you round the nearest corner and head north. And so north you continue.\n"
"Eventually, you reach an art gallery nestled between several age-old buildings. The whistling here is fevered and unpleasant, like a boiling kettle. Though the gallery is closed at this late hour, you are able to easily find an open side entrance. You brace yourself and enter the gallery, where dozens of Nepalese sculptures and paintings are on display—many carved out of wood or stone, others made out of ashtadhatu, an amalgam of eight different metals, and still others made of terra cotta. The whistling suddenly stops the moment you reach the rearmost section of the gallery, where a single lot remains strangely empty. There is no trace of what might have been there; just an empty space where something historic and treasured is clearly meant to be. Then, a lone voice pierces the sudden quiet, speaking in a language you do not understand.\n"
"You turn on your heels, body tensing. On the other end of the hall is a girl dressed in white, her figure seemingly ethereal in the faint beams of fading sunlight that permeate through the building. Her long black hair is draped over her face, masking her expression. A long scarlet sash wrapped around her waist flutters behind her, despite the fact that there is no breeze.\n"
"You freeze. The figure of the girl does not move. Her hair and sash drift steadily in the stillness. Then, she speaks once more. Again, you don’t understand a single word of it, though you notice that she has switched languages. Recognizing a few root words, you realize she is using Latin. She speaks again, this time in what sounds like ancient Greek. If she is trying to communicate with you, it may be wise to play along. You ask her what she is doing here; why she guided you here. Her response is in yet another language that eludes you, this one sounding somewhat like a blend of Egyptian and Greek."

"一陣冷風帶著刺耳的鳴響吹過加德滿都的街道。北方，喜馬拉雅山脈高聳的矗立著，山峰被落日的餘光染成紅色，粉色與紫色將天空染成鮮豔的畫作。你可以看著這幅美景直到永遠……但你有工作得做。即使在安寧平靜的夜晚，尖銳的哨聲依然沒有止息，不安感在你腦後徘徊。夜色漸濃，哨聲也隨之增大，你發現只有自己能聽見這個怪聲，就像它直接與你連結，就像它也在聆聽你；就像它認識你一樣。你閉上眼睛專注在聽力上，很難辨識聲音是從哪裡傳來的，它感覺圍繞著你，同時在街道之間產生回音。但當你向北走時，音量越來越大，所以你繼續向北方前進。\n"
"哨聲引領你來到一間混雜在數座古老建築間的藝廊，哨聲變的刺耳惱人，像煮沸的茶壺。雖然藝廊在這個時間已經關門，你還是設法從側門進入了。你小心的走進藝廊，看見許多尼泊爾的畫作與雕塑，大多是以木石為材料，有些使用埃什塔都——一種八種金屬混合的合金，還有一些陶製品。哨聲在你走到藝廊末端時倏然而止，你站在一個空的展示格前。你看不出這裡原本應該放著什麼東西，但明顯應該要有某種文物或寶物放在這裡。突然，有一個孤寂的聲音打破寂靜，說著你不懂的語言。\n"
"你緊繃的轉過身，在大廳的另一端有一名全身白色的少女，她的身影在透進來的夕陽餘光下顯得飄渺虛無。黑色的長髮遮住了她的臉龐，一條長長的紅絲帶繫在她的腰間。雖然沒有風，但絲帶卻在她身後飄盪。\n"
"你僵住了，少女的身影也紋絲不動，但她的頭髮與絲帶卻依然在無風的狀況下飄動。她再度開口，你依然無法辨認，但你發現她換了一種語言。你從幾個單字中聽出她正說著拉丁文。接著似乎是古希臘文，她似乎正嘗試與你溝通。也許跟著嘗試會是好主意，你開始詢問為什麼她在這裡？為什麼引領你來這？她用另一個你聽不懂的語言回應，這次聽起來像是埃及跟希臘語的混合。"

msgid "In your travels, you’ve been to quite a few places. You’re no stranger to different languages. You attempt a few of your own, but each time you are met with silence. And yet, she appears to want to communicate with you, and is consistently switching languages herself, only without any overlap. Is she only able to speak in long-dead languages?"
msgstr "你在旅行中曾到過許多地方，你對不同的語言並不陌生。你也嘗試了幾種，但只得到沉默的回應。她看起來很想跟你溝通，不斷變換著不同語言，但你們找不到共通的語言。難道她只會說已經絕跡的語言嗎？"

msgid "Due to the language barrier, it’s difficult to get a sense for what she wants from you. As you attempt to decipher her intent, she approaches slowly, her steps making no sound whatsoever along the wooden floor. She gestures to the empty lot next to you and whistles softly, as though the sound might carry with it some meaning. You wonder if perhaps there might have once been something here, and then realize: it is gone, vanished from history without so much as a trace. You recall the woman’s name from the Foundation’s dossier and ask her if she is also on the trail of the entities responsible for these kinds of disappearances. Aliki Uperetria does not seem to understand you, but she tilts her head in recognition at the sound of her own name. Then she wrenches something from around her neck and extends it to you in a closed fist."
msgstr "由於語言障礙，你很難理解她希望你做什麼。你正嘗試分析她的意圖時，她慢慢靠近，她的腳踏在木地板上卻沒發出任何聲音。她指向空蕩的展示格並小聲吹著口哨，好像聲音本身代表著某種意義。你思考著原本放在這裡的可能是什麼東西，然後你靈光一閃：它一定是消失了，從歷史中被抹去。你想起卷宗上少女的名字，追問她是否也在調查造成這一切消失事件的存在。阿利琪·烏佩雷特里亞看似聽不懂你的話，但聽到名字時歪了歪頭，似乎認出了自己的名字。接著她從脖子上拿下某樣東西握在手中伸向你。"

msgid "You extend your hand, and a small device on a silver chain falls into your palm. It is a whistle, carved out of bone to look like the head and beak of a white raven. Glancing back up at Aliki, she points toward the plaque next to the empty lot and says something once more in what sounds to you like Latin. You ask what she is after, and what the significance of the whistle is, but she remains cryptically silent. Turning over the whistle in your hand, you find no markings or clues as to its purpose. When you glance back up to question Aliki, she has vanished, replaced once more with a cold wind that seeps into your skin. Then, though no one else seems to hear it, the piping returns, soul-wrenching, ear-splitting. It does not cease for as long as the whistle remains in your possession."
msgstr "你伸出手，一個連著銀色鍊條的物品掉入你的掌中，是一個骨雕的哨子，外型是一隻白色渡鴉的頭。你抬頭看阿利琪，她指向空置展示格的銘牌，然後再次用拉丁文說了些什麼。你問她想要什麼，這個哨子又象徵著什麼，但她依然保持沉默。你將哨子在手中翻轉檢視，沒看見任何透露它功能的記號跟線索。當你再次抬頭想詢問阿利琪時，她已經消失了，只留下一陣刺骨的冷風。接著尖銳刺耳的哨聲又回來了，但似乎除了你沒人聽見。只要你還帶著那個哨子，哨音似乎永不會停息。"

msgid "You back away with caution. If a member of the Coterie—especially one as cryptic and potentially dangerous as Aliki—is offering you something, it can’t mean anything good. Besides, your mission is to ensure they cannot collect any more Keys, not to cooperate with them… right? Aliki’s hand lowers, along with the temperature in the room. She seems to sense your mistrust and return it tenfold, though she no longer attempts to speak. Moments later, the cold wind returns, and to your surprise, she is gone."
msgstr "你謹慎地退後，如果結社的成員，尤其是像阿利琪這樣詭異且有潛在危險的人，想給你東西時,一定不會有什麼好事。而且，你的任務是阻止他們得到更多密鑰，而不是跟他們合作，對吧……？阿利琪放下手，氣溫突然也下降了幾度，她看似感應到了你的不信任，也隨之做出相同反應，不再試著跟你說話。過了一會兒，冷風再度吹來，而你很驚訝的發現她突然消失了。"
