"A set of obscure and overly-complex instructions leads you to a drab two-story stone building on the edge of San Francisco’s Chinatown neighborhood. Inside, a bored attendant slumps behind a desk near a brass elevator. Punching a specific code, the elevator takes you deep underground, farther than you could have predicted. On –14F, you step out and are greeted by an imposing man in a well-tailored suit and black fedora. “Archibald Hudson. We met in London,” he reminds you. “Your cell is quite the talk around the office.” The agent leads you down a seemingly endless hallway lined with alcoves. Each alcove displays something different: a model of a hollow earth, a crystal skull, a map with ley lines and other unknown markings. You pause and look at a half-eaten ear of corn, still steaming.\n"
"“From what I hear, that corn’s been cooked to perfection for the last two decades. So’s the dame who was eating it,” Agent Hudson says grimly. Looking at the paradimensional relics gives you a headache. Your eyes struggle to focus on them: they are both there and not there at the same time. Hudson ushers you down a side hall into a boxy room crammed with metal filing cabinets and sits down behind a heavy wooden desk. He speaks into a ring-and-spring microphone: “File #26–G2. Interview conducted by Hudson, Archibald, designation 42a6-951. That’s Agent Hudson to you,” he arches an eyebrow. Over the next several hours, you answer a gauntlet of grueling questions about your experience thus far, ranging from the past day to your experience in London. When it’s all done, Agent Hudson leans back and lights a cigarette. “I’ll admit, I was skeptical about you from the start. But Commissioner Taylor has good instincts, and I haven’t seen them steer her wrong yet,” he says. “You’ve done good work so far. We have some intel and some resources that might be useful for you. Tell me what the Foundation can do for you.”"

"雜亂無章的建築群引領你到一棟座落在舊金山中國城邊緣的單調雙層石製建築。一名接待員無聊地坐在裡面的桌子後面，旁邊是一台黃銅電梯。接待員依特殊的順序按下幾個鍵，似乎是密碼，電梯開始下降到地下，比你意想之中的還要深。地下14樓，你踏出電梯，一名身穿合身西裝，頭戴軟帽的魁武男人上前迎接你。“我是阿齊伯爾德·韓德森，我們在倫敦見過面。”他提醒你，“局裡都在談論你們呢。”這名探員領著你走過看似沒有盡頭、兩側有無數壁龕的走廊。每個壁龕裡都展示著不同的東西：空心地球的模型、水晶骷髏、畫滿密道與未知記號的地圖。在看到一根吃到一半的玉米時你不禁停下腳步，它居然還在冒煙。\n"
"“據我聽到的說法，那根玉米在二十年前就煮好了，還順便帶走了吃它的老太太。”韓德森探員奸笑著說。看著這些超次元的物品讓你感到頭痛，你的眼睛很難聚焦，彷彿它們存在，同時又不存在一樣。韓德森催促你走進旁邊一個方形的小房間，裡面塞滿金屬製的檔案櫃。他坐到厚重的木桌後，對著一組有線麥克風說：“申請調閱檔案#26-G2，調閱者阿齊伯爾德·韓德森，座標42a6-951，韓德森探員。”然後他對你抬起一邊眉毛。接下來的幾個小時，你遭受各種細微的問題轟炸，從你最近的行動一路回溯到倫敦的事件，鉅細靡遺。問完後，韓德森探員靠回椅背並點了一支菸。“我承認，我一開始並不看好你。但調查官泰勒的直覺一向很準，從沒出錯過。”他說到。“你目前為止都做得不錯，我們有一些你用得上的情報跟資源，告訴我基石能幫你什麼忙。”"

msgid "Agent Hudson flips through some files and pulls out an updated dossier similar to the one in your possession, but much thicker. “Subject #11–B, calls herself ‘Amaranth.’ But this is not the first Amaranth the Foundation has encountered. She pops back up every few decades, looking completely different each time. This iteration bears a striking resemblance to a former student of a ‘Miskatonic University’ in Massachusetts. Eryn Cochwyn was her name. She’s been missing for some time.” You wonder aloud if it might be a coincidence. “There are no coincidences in our line of work,” he mutters."
