"It’s a good thing the locals here are fairly welcoming and don’t seem to mind you asking directions, because “abandoned cigar factory” doesn’t exactly narrow things down. The bustling Ybor City district near Tampa is home to many such factories built and run by thousands of immigrants from all over. If you had to check each and every factory, you’d be here all week. Luckily, you have a lead just north of the bay: a quiet, run-down building with an adjoining boarded-up warehouse. If you didn’t know the truth, you’d think it was nothing more than an out-of-date factory from the ’80s, probably filled with nothing more than dust and rats. But if you’ve learned anything in your travels, it’s to never trust the evidence of your eyes.\n"
"You cautiously approach the main entrance and attempt to open it. As you suspected, it does not budge. If this is truly a Coterie sanctum, it’ll be harder than that to get inside. There’s no easy way in through the third-story windows, so you circle around the side of the warehouse, spotting a large metal door likely used for loading goods or unloading supplies. As there is no handle or lever, you decide to knock. A moment later, a gruff voice responds from the other side: “Passphrase.”"

"幸好當地人熱情好客，而且不介意為你指引方向，因為“廢棄的雪茄廠”根本無助於縮小範圍。在這個鄰近坦帕的繁榮區域有許多這種由大量移民人口經營的工廠。如果你得一家一家搜索，那你可能得在這裡待上一整個禮拜。幸運的是，你在海灣北邊找到了一間安靜的老舊建築，旁邊還有加蓋的倉庫。如果你沒得到情報，也會以為這裡只是一座上個世紀留下的過時工廠，裡面可能只有灰塵跟老鼠。但如果這一場旅途教會了你什麼，那就是眼見不一定為憑。\n"
"你小心的靠近主要入口並試著推開門，如你所想，它紋絲不動。如果這裡真的是結社的據點，那你當然沒這麼容易能進去。看起來也不可能從三層樓高的窗戶進入，所以你繞到倉庫側面，發現一個巨大的金屬門，也許是用來裝卸貨物的地方。門上沒有任何把手，所以你決定敲門。一段時間後，門另一邊傳來一個粗啞的聲音說：“暗號？”"

"You lean in and utter the words that Desi taught you—”Blackbird Solitaire”—and the door slides open. On the other side, a muscular man with a thick mustache gives you a toothy grin. The hand hovering just over the handle of a revolver holstered at his side gives you pause, but after a moment, he steps aside to let you in. “Boss said you might be stopping by,” the doorman says. “He said to let you look around and take whatever you need.”\n"
"You step inside and eye the man carefully. Last thing you need is a bullet in the back just as soon as you begin your search. As if sensing your concern, he slowly unholsters his gun and empties the cylinder. “Look, friend. I know what you did for Desi. Any friend of his is a friend of mine,” he states, meeting your suspicious gaze head-on. “Whatever you’re looking for, it’s yours.”\n"
"It doesn’t take too long for you to find the Key Desi had stashed here. Mounted on a far wall of the warehouse, over a midst of a trove of supplies and ammunition, its alien sheen reflects a warped view of your startled countenance. It is a double-edged blade of considerable length, although it has no handle or grip with which to wield it. It might be a weapon, but it is no mortal one, that is for sure.\n"
"“That old thing?” the gruff man asks as you delicately remove it from its mount. “Just a weird hunk of metal, that is. Thought Desi just kept it here for kicks. Creeps the hell out of me.” As you hold the blade over both of your hands, a gentle pulse of energy quivers through its length. Not a decoration, then—this is the real deal.\n"
"You also sift througth some of Desi’s records and intel while you are here. Not much that you don’t already know, but it looks like he’s been keeping tabs on a few of his cohorts. There are more than a few clandestine photographs of a woman carrying a red parasol over her shoulder. In the clearest of these, the woman is giving the camera a knowing smirk. She knew Desi was on to her. On the back, in sloppy handwriting, black ink reads: “You’re in too deep this time, Tzu.”\n"
"You browse a bit more, but you aren’t going to find much else here. Desi’s operation is quite a bit different from the Coterie’s stated goals, it seems. Perhaps there is more to them than the Foundation believes. Or, it’s just another front. Doesn’t matter. You have what you came for."

"你向前靠說出德西告訴你的暗號——“黑鳥鑽石”，然後門滑開了。一名壯碩的大鬍子男人對你露齒而笑，但當看見他懸在腰間手槍上的手時，你僵硬了一下。不過他馬上讓到一邊放你進去。他開口說：“老大說你可能會來。他還說你可以到處看看，想拿什麼都可以。”\n"
"你踏進倉庫，但警戒的看著那個男人，你最不希望的就是在搜索時背後挨子彈。那名門衛似乎感覺到你的顧慮，他慢慢的將槍從腰間拔出來並清空槍膛。“朋友你看，我知道你為德西做的事，德西的朋友就是我朋友。”他邊說邊對上你懷疑的眼神。“不管你是來找什麼，它都是你的了。”\n"
"你很快就找到德西存放在這裡的密鑰。它掛在倉庫深處的一面牆上，在大量的補給品跟彈藥之間。它散發著異樣的光芒，你驚嘆的表情歪斜的倒映在它的表面。這是一把相當長的雙刃匕首，但沒有刀柄可供抓握。這是一把武器，但顯然不是來自凡間的。\n"
"“你要的是那個老東西？”那個粗曠的男人在你小心的將密鑰拿下來時問到。“那是一塊奇怪的金屬，德西只是一時好玩把它放在這，但它讓我渾身都不對勁。”你雙手握住它時，感覺到一股力量的脈動從刀身傳來。雖然外表樸素，但它絕對是致命的武器。\n"
"你順便翻看了一些德西的調查紀錄，雖然大多數都是你已知的情報，但看起來德西正在追查幾位他的同胞。許多照片中都有一名拿著鮮紅色陽傘的女子，其中一張最清楚的照片中，那名女子正對著鏡頭微笑，看來她早就知道德西在追蹤她。照片背面有段潦草的字跡寫著：“妳陷得太深了，梓。”\n"
"你又到處看了一下，但沒有再找到什麼值得關注的東西。德西的行動似乎跟結社的目標相違背，看來結社也許比基石想像的更複雜，又或許這只是他們其中一個偽裝。不重要了，你已經達成來這裡的目的了。"
