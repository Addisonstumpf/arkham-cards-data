"Soon after arriving in Tokyo, you wander the city’s winding streets in the rain before sitting down at a food stall. Before you can order, a figure in a trenchcoat and wide-brimmed hat sits down next to you and whispers a phrase in a crisp British accent: “Six lions prowl at dusk.”\n"
"The phrase’s significance dawns on you after a moment, and you hurriedly recite the callback the Foundation operatives taught you: “A pride feasts in darkness.” The person next to you lowers the wide brim of her coat to reveal herself as Commissioner Taylor. She orders ramen for you both and looks away. “Before you ask: No, this is not a coincidence, and no, I will not tell you how I knew you would be here. It is my job to know more than you.”\n"
"You tell her she seems as brusque as usual, and a faint smile tugs at the edge of her lips. “Familiarity breeds liability, so let us keep this professional. Tell me what you have learned so far.” You shoot a worried look at the crowd around you. The commissioner shakes her head. “I saw to it that you were not followed. Talk.” Your eyes wander to the gun holstered to her belt, and you wonder what lengths she went to in the name of privacy.\n"
"Digging into the steaming bowl of ramen, you recount your findings so far. The rain falls hard around you, mingling with the smell of grilled meats and sweet spices. You spy a flash of red in the crowd, but when you look, all you see is the reflection on a blood-red fan. The commissioner snaps her fingers and you continue. Once you finish your report, Taylor pays for the meal and stands.\n"
"“It sounds as though your efforts are, shall we say, adequate?” she says primly. “However, the Foundation has a request. We need you to deliver a package to our sanctum in Lagos. Please see that it is delivered safely.” She hands you a sheaf of documents bound with cord."

"你走在東京起風下雨的街道上，找了一間攤販坐了下來。在你還沒來得及點餐前，一個穿著風衣、帶著寬邊帽的人在你旁邊坐下，用清脆的英國腔低語道：“六隻獅子於黃昏狩獵。”\n"
"你遲疑了一下後想起了這句話代表的意義，你趕緊用基石探員教你的暗語回應：“黑暗中的傲人饗宴。”身旁的人放低衣領，是調查官泰勒。她幫你們各叫了一碗拉麵然後撇開視線。“在你開口問前，不，這不是巧合。不會，我不會告訴你我是怎麼知道你在這的。我的工作就是掌握比你更多的情報。”\n"
"你告訴她你很高興看到她依然這麼難搞，她的嘴角露出一絲微笑。“親近產生怠惰，所以我們還是保持公事公辦吧。告訴我你目前調查到的事。”你擔心的看了一眼周遭的人群，調查官搖搖頭說：“我幫你確認過沒有人跟蹤了，說吧。”你的目光飄向她腰間的槍，希望她接下來不要過於刺探你的隱私。\n"
"你邊攪動熱氣騰騰的拉麵邊告訴她目前為止的收穫。雨勢越來越大，混合著烤肉跟香料的香味，你瞄見人群中有一絲紅色閃過，但仔細一看，那不過是一個紅色風扇的倒影。調查官彈了一下手指示意你繼續。當你報告完後，泰勒起身並結帳。\n"
"“你目前的表現，怎麼說呢，合格了？”她認真的說。“但基石有另一項任務要交給你。我們需要你將一份檔案送去位於拉哥斯的機密地點。請保證它安全送達。”她交給你一份用細繩繫起的文件。"

Reciting a phrase written in your instructions, you whisper: “Six lions prowl at dusk.” The figure lowers the brim of their hat and recites the callback: “A pride feasts in darkness.” Relaxing your guard, you hand the Foundation operative the documents, and they retreat into the shadows."
msgstr "你鑽過擁擠的街道，在暗巷跟一個身影會面。你低聲說出指示上的暗語：“六隻獅子於黃昏狩獵”，那個身影拉下帽沿說出回應：“黑暗中的傲人饗宴”。你放下戒備，將文件交給他。接著他就退回暗影了之中。"
