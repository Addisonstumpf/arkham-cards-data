"A heavy grey mist hangs in the air above Lake Victoria as your biplane touches down on a dusty runway. All leads in Nairobi about a Tuwile Masai point to the shoreline of Lake Victoria, where the Coterie member is said to have transported several tons of survey equipment. A faint but sharp scent of alkaline carries on the breeze as you walk to the lake, where several large boats are laden with heavy machinery at the shoreline. Sunlight catches on a pair of thick-rimmed spectacles down at the pier.\n"
"“Professor Masai?” you greet the wiry man as he steps ashore. Masai looks nervously past you as he wipes his glasses."

"你的飛機降落在塵土飛揚的跑道上，灰色的霧氣籠罩著維多利亞湖。你在奈洛比查到所有關於圖維勒·馬賽的線索都指向維多利亞湖，他運送了許多研究器材到這裡。你走在湖邊時從風中聞到一股令人暈眩的強烈鹼土氣味，幾艘裝載沉重機械的船停在湖岸邊，你看見碼頭上有副厚重的鏡框反射著陽光。\n"
"“馬賽教授？”你向站在湖邊的結實男子打招呼，他在你靠近時緊張的擦拭著眼鏡。"

"“Your reputation precedes you. As did the sound of your aeroplane,” Masai smiles, though you can sense a nervous undercurrent in his demeanor. “You have caught me at just the right time. Would you care to accompany me out to the water?”\n"
"You cordially accept, and the professor leads you to board the boat to take a seat at at the stern. A half dozen crew members board, and the engine thrums to life as you cut a path across the glassy surface of the lake. After setting course, the professor hunches in his seat across from you and studies you through heavy red-rimmed glasses. “In truth, I am surprised you sought me out. I am hardly the mover and shaker I once was in the Coterie. Now, their concerns seem trivial in comparison with all the great work that must be done.”\n"
"When you ask about his great work, the professor smiles. “It is the work of every person. What is it to be human except to live and help others in this great and perilous world? It’s harder than you might think.” He leafs through several papers, holding them tightly as the wind off Lake Victoria picks up. Masai shows you several complicated graphs and charts.\n"
"“The lakebed here is covered in the ruins of a sunken city built long ago. I happened upon it when monitoring acidity and chemical levels. Something was increasing—or perhaps better put: producing—an incredible amount of carbon dioxide. Along with several odd mutations in local fauna and flora. After several months of searching, we were able to trace the production to its source.” The professor pinpoints a red X on a large map of Lake Victoria. You ask if that is where the boat is headed now, and the professor chuckles. “No. It is already done. The source of the unusual production was an object of power. A Key. We drudged it up just last week.”\n"
"The hair on the back of your neck raises as the crew cuts power to the engine. None of them appear armed, but you are suddenly aware of your vulnerable position.\n"
"“Don’t fear for your life, my friend,” Masai rubs his glasses with a cloth. “I am not your enemy. Though I do worry for the Coterie itself. There is something strange at work among them. The one with the gloves in particular. He has been silent for too long, I think.” The professor sighs and leans back in his seat. Around you, the placid water of Lake Victoria ripples, dreamlike, as a heavy storm stirs the clouds overhead.\n"
"“It’s yours, of course,” Masai says, eyes closed, as he looks up at the sky. “The artifact we found was some infernal machine that was still running, even now, at the bottom of the lake. I wonder who started it, and when? And what will happen if it ever stops running? Either way, if your track record with my colleagues is to be believed, it is safer in your hands than in mine.” He opens his eyes and stares at the surface of the lake as the crew rev the engine.\n"
"“Perhaps you will succeed where I failed.”"

"“你的名聲比你先到了，你的飛機聲也是。”馬賽笑著說，但你感覺到有種不安隱藏在他的外表下。“你來的正好，介意跟我一起到水裡走一趟嗎？”\n"
"你親切的答應了，教授領著你登上一艘船並在船尾坐下。六名工作人員隨你們登船，引擎作響，帶你們劃過如鏡面一般的湖水。設定好航向後，教授坐回你對面的位子，透過紅色的厚框眼鏡打量你。“事實上，我很驚訝你會來找我。我在結社中的影響力已經大不如前了。現在他們只在乎那些無謂的競賽，而忽略了遠大的目標。”\n"
"你詢問遠大目標是什麼，教授笑著回答：“這是屬於每一個人的事業，如果人類在這個偉大但危險的世界不互相幫助的話，要怎麼存活下來呢？但這比你想像的更困難。”他翻出幾張文件，握緊它們以免被風吹走，他給你看了幾張複雜的圖片跟表格。\n"
"“這裡的湖床中埋著一座沉沒的遠古遺跡。我在監測酸鹼度與化學變化時發現有東西在增加，更準確的說——在製造大量的二氧化碳，附近區域也發現不明的動植物突變。經過幾個月的調查後，我們找到了來源。”教授指著維多利亞湖地圖上的一個紅色記號，你問你們是否正是要前往這裡搜尋。教授輕笑一聲說：“不，我們已經找到了。這個來源就是一件具有力量的物件，一個密鑰，我們上個禮拜確認了。”\n"
"當船員將引擎熄火時，你頸後的寒毛豎了起來。看起來沒人帶著武器，但你突然意識到自己不利的處境。\n"
"“别害怕，我的朋友。”教授邊用布擦拭眼鏡邊說。“我不是你的敵人。但我確實擔心結社中有某種不對勁的事正在發生。尤其是戴著手套的那位，我認為他沉寂太久了。”教授嘆口氣靠回座椅上。平靜的維多利亞湖水圍繞著你們，如夢似幻的泛著漣漪。一場風暴正在你們頭頂的雲層中醞釀。\n"
"馬賽閉起眼睛望向天空：“當然，它是你的了。我們找到的這個東西是地獄般的機械，就連現在，它也持續在湖底運轉著。我不知道是誰啟動它的，又是何時啟動的？而它停止運轉後又會發生什麼事？不管怎樣，如果你真的像我的同志們說的一樣值得信賴，那它在你手中會比在我手中更安全。”他睜開眼睛看著船員們打撈引擎。\n"
"“也許你能在我失敗的地方取得成功。”"

"“I’m terribly sorry, but I don’t have time to chat,” Masai says as he steps lightly past you. You follow him, pressing for some assistance or insight, anything that can help in your struggle with the Red Coterie. “Ah. I had no idea I was dealing with the Foundation. You must be new.” Masai regards you in a new light, then leads you to sit in a makeshift camp. “Very well. Please wait here, and I’ll help you as soon as I can.”\n"
"You sit in a comedically short camping chair under the awning as the professor walks out of view. The minutes drift away as the clouds overhead break and a heavy rain begins to fall. After waiting for some time, you stand up and look out to the shoreline: the boats have gone. When you ask the locals for the professor’s whereabouts, they tell you he ended his survey and paid for passage across the lake.\n"
"After returning to Nairobi, you check with the British Consulate and discover that Masai’s travel expenses were being footed by his fellowship with Oxford. His declaration of travel includes an obscure address in Bermuda. Pocketing the information, you continue your travels."

"“我很抱歉，但我沒時間閒聊。”他匆匆從你身邊走過。你跟著他，對他施壓，要求他給你一些關於緋紅結社的情報。馬賽用不同的眼神打量著你：“喔，我不知道你是基石的人，你一定是新來的。”他領著你到一頂帳篷中，並在其中坐下。“很好，請在這裡稍等，我一有空就馬上過來。”\n"
"你在帳篷雨棚下的矮凳坐下，看著教授的身影消失在視野中。過了幾分鐘後，天空下起了傾盆大雨。在等了一陣子後，你起身看向湖岸，船隻都不見了。你詢問當地人教授去哪了，他們說他的調查結束了，並坐船到湖對面去了。\n"
"你回到奈洛比後與英國領事館聯絡，他們查到馬賽的旅費登記在他牛津的協會之下，記錄中有一個位於百慕達的模糊地點。你記下情報，準備繼續旅程。"
