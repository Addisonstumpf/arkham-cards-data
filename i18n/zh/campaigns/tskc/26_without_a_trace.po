"Even with the Foundation’s resources at your beck and call, it takes some finagling to charter a ship across the Devil’s Triangle, especially given you have no cargo to speak of and refuse to allow any other passengers on board, for their safety. After all, if your theory is correct, this ship’s destination does not exist on any map, and for all you know, it might be a one-way journey. Agent Quinn has convinced one of her colleagues to helm the ship, so as to not endanger a civilian, and together you set off for the center of the triangle, hearts in throats.\n"
"“The commissioner will have gotten word by now,” Quinn says, standing with you at the helm of the ship. “Probably the end of my career, I would wager.” She stares off at the horizon as the sun dips just below the waves. Despite her words, her expression is steadfast, without even a hint of regret. “I just hope we find answers.” You concede, with a bit of trepidation, that you almost hope you don’t. The idea of ending up just like the people who have been snatched—it chills you to the core. “Well, no turning back now. Care to do the honors?” she asks, motioning toward the white raven whistle which hangs from a cord around your neck. You pull it off and clutch it in your palm, considering your options."

"即使有基石的資源做後盾，你還是得運用一些欺瞞技巧才能找到願意前往惡魔三角的船隻，尤其又加上你沒有貨物也不允許其他乘客上船。但這是為了安全著想，畢竟如果你的假設是對的，你的目的地並不在地圖上，而且很可能有去無回。奎茵探員設法說服了一位她的同事來掌舵，這樣就不會有平民受害了。你們懸著一顆心，向三角區域的中心出發。\n"
"奎茵站在舵輪旁說：“調查官現在應該已經收到消息了。我想我的事業就到此為止了。”她看著遠方的太陽隱沒在波濤之下，雖然口中這樣說，但她的表情堅定，沒有一絲後悔。“我只希望能找到答案。”你出聲同意，但還是不禁感到一絲不安。你們可能會落得跟那些被抓走的人一樣的下場，想到這個就有一陣寒意滲入骨髓。“好吧，來不及反悔了，你來嗎？”她看著掛在你脖子上的白色渡鴉哨子說。你將它握在掌中，思考著你的選擇。"

msgid "Blow the whistle and summon Aliki to your side."
msgstr "吹響哨子召喚阿利琪前來。"

msgid "Dispose of the whistle and do this alone."
msgstr "扔掉哨子，獨自面對。"

msgid "Reluctantly, you put the whistle to your lips and send its shrill, otherworldly warble across the ocean and perhaps beyond. A shudder creeps up your spine as the wind picks up. Within moments, the girl with the red sash has appeared, standing on the deck of your ship as though she had always been there. She speaks in Coptic, her words muffled by whistling wind. “She says thank you,” Quinn translates, “for trusting her.” You wouldn’t go that far. But she seems to know more about where you’re going than you do, and you need every bit of help you can get if you are to survive. Then, just as the wind begins to die down, Aliki Uperetria turns and points over the bow of the ship, seemingly at nothing at all but dark, choppy waves and the dim evening horizon."
msgstr "你不情願地將哨子放到嘴邊，吹出了尖銳的聲響，奇異的聲音跨越，甚至穿透了海洋。逐漸增強的風勢讓你打從脊柱感到一陣冷顫。沒過多久，綁著紅絲帶的少女就現身在甲板上，好像她一直都在這一樣。她說了一句科普特語，但在風聲中變得難以辨識，奎茵翻譯到：“她說謝謝，謝謝你願意信任她。”但你可稱不上是信任她，只是因為她看起來比你更了解接下來會發生什麼事，而你想盡可能取得能讓你活下來的助力。接著就在風勢逐漸減弱時，阿利琪·烏佩雷特里亞轉身指向船頭的方向，但前方看起來沒什麼特別的，只有黑暗、起伏的海浪跟昏暗的地平線。"

msgid "the cell blew the whistle."
msgstr "吹響哨子。"

msgid "After a moment of consideration, you hurl the whistle into the dark waves of the Atlantic. Quinn watches with horror as the ocean swallows it. “What did you do that for? She could have helped us!” You explain that the Coterie is not to be trusted, and that perhaps now—with the evidence of their cooperation disposed of—Taylor will allow Quinn to keep her position in the Foundation. “You did that… for me?” she says under her breath, stunned. “Well… I hope for our sake you know what you are doing. Where we are headed, we are going to need all the help we can get.” She glances over the bow of the ship, and you wonder if you are truly headed to another realm, or if you will simply greet the horizon."
msgstr "經過考慮後，你將哨子拋進了大西洋的波濤中，奎茵驚恐地看著海浪將它吞噬。“你為什麼要這麼做？她可以幫我們的！”你解釋到不能信任結社，而也許現在跟他們合作的證據消失了，泰勒或許會讓奎茵保住她在基石的工作。“你是……為了我？”她驚訝地倒抽一口氣。“嗯……為了我們好，我希望你清楚自己在做什麼。在我們將要去的地方，我們會需要所有可能的協助。”她看向船頭，懷疑著你們是真的要前往另一個次元；又或只是正朝地平線另一端開去。"

msgid "In your Campaign Log, record <i>Agent Quinn has your back</i>. Any one investigator may choose to add the Agent Ari Quinn story asset to their deck. It does not count toward their deck size. This card can be found in the <i>Globetrotting</i> encounter set."

"Clouds hang still over the Atlantic, the ocean suddenly calmer than you have ever seen it before. “Look at that,” Quinn says, pointing at the surface of the water. “No fish, no waves, not even a ripple from the ship.” A feeling of regret in your throat, you rush to the bow of the ship and look out into the distance. Something in the air shimmers—a slight distortion, nothing more—just a trick of the eye—and then, without a moment of warning, the ship is swallowed whole. The clouds burst. Light and color and luster overtakes you, cosmic radiance swathed in transcendental mist. The sight is marvelous and awful, mesmerizing and haunting all at once. You shut your eyes, but colors wash behind your eyelids over and over and over again. Then, finally, what feels like an eternity later, you feel a tap on your shoulder and open your eyes. The sight that greets you is unlike anything you have ever seen.\n"
"Aliki was right—if the things that disappeared were taken, this is surely where they ended up: an impossibly jumbled city of twisting architecture and technology both alien and familiar, an unearthly repository for everything that has ever been forgotten and forsaken. A range of sickly purples span the sky above, and snaking throughout the tangled towers and effigies are swirling, shimmering entities of vapor and colorless radiance.\n"
"Stunned into silence, you simply stare at the horrifying, awe-inspiring horizon before you, devoid of ocean, devoid of humanity, devoid of life. This is the barren truth to which your investigation has led: The Outside."

"雲層飄在大西洋的天空中，海面突然變得前所未有的平靜。奎茵指著水面說：“看，沒有魚、沒有波浪，連船身造成的漣漪都沒有。”一股後悔的感覺突然湧上心頭，你衝向船頭看著遠方，空氣中有某種閃光，微微的扭曲，也許只是光線造成的錯覺——突然，毫無預兆地，整艘船都被吞噬。雲層爆炸了，光線、色彩跟宇宙輻射形成的超現實迷霧包圍了你。這個景象既神奇又恐怖；既迷人又令人不適。你閉上眼睛，但感覺各種色彩一次又一次刮過你的眼皮。最後，像是經過了永恆，你感覺有人碰了你的肩膀，你張開眼，看見一幅前所未見的景象。\n"
"阿利琪是對的，如果某樣東西被帶走了，那這裡就是它的終點。違反常理的雜亂城市中充滿了扭曲的建築；各種熟悉與陌生的科技產物。這是一座埋葬被遺忘跟遺棄事物的外星墳場。一抹病態的紫色在天空中蔓延，以霧氣與無色輻射組成的存在用牠發光、扭動的觸手纏上各種塔樓與塑像。\n"
"你驚訝得說不出話，只是盯著你面前可怕同時又令人驚嘆的景象。沒有海洋、沒有人類、沒有生命的氣息，你的調查引領你來到這個真相所在的不毛之地，這裡是——異域。"

"You awaken on the ship’s deck, dreamlike memories and otherworldly visions swimming in your mind. The only sign that what you saw was real and not a mere nightmare is the pained groans of Agent Quinn as she rises steadily to her feet and pulls you up. The world wobbles as your vision settles over a new dimension.\n"
"“What the hell,” Quinn utters under her breath. “What the hell.” You struggle in vain to comprehend what you experienced in that other world. Answers may have eluded you, but it’s a relief to stand once more in a place that feels familiar to you. “That place… it is just as Aliki thought,” Quinn says aloud, her eyes wide with both awe and horror. “Everything that is missing. Everything that is forgotten. It’s all there. Is that what they are doing? Stealing our world?”\n"
"You ponder what all of this could mean in silence as night falls over the Atlantic. This is what Aliki had been afraid of—why she had come to you for help. But you are still uncertain what the entities from that reality truly want with yours, and what it might mean for the Red Coterie. “What do we do now? I don’t even know how I would report this to the Commissioner. Even for us, it’s almost too far-fetched to believe. And we have nothing to show for it…”\n"

"你在甲板上醒來，夢境般的回憶與外域的異象依然徘徊在你的腦海裡。唯一將你拉回現實的是奎茵探員起身時發出的痛苦呻吟。在看過另一個次元後，你們的視線都還有點模糊。\n"
"奎茵倒抽了一口氣說道：“那是什麼鬼東西。”你試著分析在另一個次元看見的東西，但徒勞無功。雖然沒有找到答案，但回到熟悉的世界讓你鬆了一口氣。奎茵說道：“那個地方……就跟阿利琪想的一樣。”她的眼睛同時因驚嘆與恐懼而放大。“所有失蹤的事物、被遺忘的事物都在那裡。這就是牠們正在做的事嗎？偷走我們的世界？”\n"
"夜幕降臨到大西洋上，你不發一語地思索著這代表著什麼。這就是阿利琪害怕的事，這就是為什麼她找上你幫忙。但你還是不清楚這些來自另一個次元的存在想從你們的次元得到什麼，而這一切對緋紅結社又意味著什麼。“我們現在該怎麼辦？我甚至不知道該怎麼跟調查官報告，就算對基石來說，這還是太難以置信了，而且我們還沒有證據可以證明……”\n"
"你搖頭並望向地平線。你身邊到底有多少的空缺只不過是那群生物接觸地球後的殘餘？如果這場祕密戰爭沒有被阻止，還有多少東西能留下？至少現在，你終於得知事情的嚴重性了……"
