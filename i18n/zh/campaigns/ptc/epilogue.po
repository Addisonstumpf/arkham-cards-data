"It has taken months of preparation, but you are finally ready to unveil your latest work to the world. Gathering financial investments was your first task, of course. That hadn’t taken too long given the connections you’d made during your stay in Paris. You have been assured that the cast assembled is the finest that money could afford, but still you strive to make everything perfect. It must be perfect. The story must be told, so that the world knows. You’ve heard the troupe whisper behind your back: the remarks about your bizarre passion, the concern about your piercing yellow eyes. It matters not to you. All you care about is the performance. The pronunciation of the words. The melody of Cassilda’s song. The design of the Stranger’s mask.\n"
"This would be the greatest performance of <u>The King in Yellow</u> ever."

"準備工作花費了好幾個月，但你終於能揭開最後一道面紗，把你最新的作品呈現給世人。吸收金融投資當然是你的第一要務。得益於你在巴黎逗留期間結識的廣博人脈，這並沒有花費你很多時間。你相信重資聘來的這批演員是最出色的班底，但你仍然要竭盡全力把一切做到盡善盡美。這齣戲必須完美無瑕。必須要讓全世界都知道這個故事。雖然你也聽到戲班子在你身後的閒言碎語：說你的激情透著古怪，說你黃色的眼睛能刺透人心。但這些對你都不重要。你只關心這次演出，關心每一個字的發音，關心卡西露達歌聲的旋律，關心陌生人面具的設計。\n"
"這一次的《黃衣之王》一定會成為史上最成功的演出。"
