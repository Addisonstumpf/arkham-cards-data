"Your head throbs with a dull ache as you drive through the rainy streets of Arkham toward your next destination. The threat of the Stranger looms in your mind, and you find yourself glancing often at your rear-view mirror, expecting to see the expressionless visage of his mask haunting you. Instead, you see nothing but the misty, starless night, and the deserted road behind you.\n"
"Your thoughts once again wander, as they have often in the past few hours, to The King in Yellow and to the city of Carcosa and its inhabitants. What was the message hidden inside that awful play, the meaning within its madness? A lone detail worms its way to the forefront of your thoughts, one made apparent by the discussions you’d overheard at Ms. Dumaine’s estate—that tonight’s performance of The King in Yellow was not the first Arkham had seen of the foul play. There had been at least one other performance, directed by the same man: Nigel Engram.\n"
"There is one place in Arkham where records are often kept of important events occuring within the city: the Historical Society’s manor house in Southside. If there are any records of the previous show of The King in Yellow, the Historical Society may have held onto them. Perhaps there you will find answers to the questions that burn in your mind."

"當你駕車從阿卡姆城雨中的街道開過，前往下一個目的地時，你的腦袋隱隱作痛。“陌生人”的威脅時而在你的腦海中浮現，你不由得時常看後視鏡，以為鏡中會出現那個男子，面戴毫無表情的面具，陰魂不散。相反，你從鏡中只看見霧濛濛的夜空，天上沒有星星，街道也空無一人。\n"
"如同過去的幾小時一樣，你的思緒再次飄到《黃衣之王》，還有卡爾克薩和城中的居民。那部可怕的戲劇裡潛藏著什麼信息，它瘋狂的劇情又意味著什麼？最先佔據你的思緒的是一個細節信息，這是你在杜梅因夫人的住處偶然聽到的——今晚的《黃衣之王》演出並不是第一齣出現在阿卡姆城的邪惡戲劇。至少曾經還有另一場演出，均由同一個人執導：奈傑爾·英格蘭姆。\n"
"城中有個地方，阿卡姆城中所發生的重大事件都會保存於此：歷史協會，位於南區的一幢宅邸。如果之前上演的《黃衣之王》留下了任何記錄，那或許就保存在歷史協會。或許所有困擾你的問題都能夠在那兒找到答案。"

msgid "Check Campaign Log. <i>If Sebastien Moreau is listed under VIPs Interviewed</i>:"
msgstr "查看冒險日誌。<i>如果在貴賓會談下方記錄有塞巴斯蒂安‧莫羅</i>："

msgid "You recall what Sebastien told you during the dinner party. The King in Yellow had come to Arkham several decades ago, long before the Ward Theatre was built. According to him, it isn’t surprising that few people remember—in fact, part of their goal tonight was to bring The King in Yellow to a wider audience. The Historical Society may have kept records pertaining to this earlier production, especially if it was followed by events similar to what has occurred tonight. Perhaps you can find some newspaper clippings or other articles describing what happened in the past."
msgstr "你想起塞巴斯蒂安在晚宴上對你說的話。數十年前，早在沃德劇院建成之前《黃衣之王》就曾在阿卡姆上演。據他所說，沒什麼人記得這件事也不足為奇——事實上，他們今晚的目標是將《黃衣之王》呈獻給更多的觀眾。歷史協會可能保留有與上一版演出相關的記錄，況且那場演出之後也發生了種種事件，與今晚發生的事件相似。或許你可以找到一些剪報或其他文章，記載著過去發生的事情。"

You decide to take it with you before continuing your investigation. The last record you find related to the original production of The King in Yellow is a psychiatric evaluation of one Daniel Chesterfield, a stagehand who lost his wits after the final show. It seems he was admitted to the asylum after the production ended. Perhaps he’s still there…"
msgstr "《黃衣之王》事件中出現了這件東西，那一定不是偶然。你心中篤信，你發現的東西十分重要，於是你決定在之後的調查中帶上它。你找到的最近一份有關《黃衣之王》早年演出的記錄，是丹尼爾‧契斯特菲爾德的精神評估報告，他是一名舞台工作人員，在最後一場演出結束後失去理智。他似乎在演出結束之後就被送進了瘋人院，或許他現在還在那兒……"

msgid "This investigation would make anybody paranoid. Attributing some greater meaning to everything you find can be a dangerous proposition. You’re sure that this clasp is meaningless, perhaps even a prop from the original play. You leave it behind and continue your investigation. The last record you find related to the original production of The King in Yellow is a psychiatric evaluation of one Daniel Chesterfield, a stagehand who lost his wits after the final show. It seems he was admitted to the asylum after the production ended. Perhaps he’s still there…"
msgstr "本次調查會讓人陷入偏執。你發覺從這一切歸結出某個更深層的意義可能會招致危險，你認為這個釦環沒什麼意義，可能不過是那場早年演出的一個道具。你將它放回原位，並且繼續進行調查。你找到的最近一份有關《黃衣之王》早年演出的記錄，是丹尼爾‧契斯特菲爾德的精神評估報告，他是一名舞台工作人員，在最後一場演出結束後失去理智。他似乎在演出結束之後就被送進了瘋人院。或許他還在那兒……"

msgid "The figure collapses to the ground, its warped, melting body writhing in agony. It wheezes and cries out, a yellow glow emanating from inside its mouth and behind its eyes. “Daniel,” the thing says in its cracking voice. “Seek Daniel… Daniel Chesterfield, the stagehand, he remembers!” Deep inside the man’s words, there is another voice behind it, whispering faintly in a melodic language. “Find him… He too has spoken the oath… The oath that doomed us all…!” With those final words, the skin melts off the man’s bones, and he rattles to the floor."
msgstr "那個人影癱倒在地，它的軀體如同遭受熔解一般，痛苦地扭曲成異常的姿態。它大口喘息，尖叫連連，黃色的光芒從他的嘴巴和眼眶中射出。“丹尼爾，” 它用沙啞的聲音說道。“找到丹尼爾……丹尼爾‧契斯特菲爾德，那個舞台工作人員，他還記得！”就在那名男子的話語背後，潛蔵著另一個聲音，以一種帶有韻律的語言發出微弱的低語：“找到他……他也宣讀了誓約……那個誓約毀了我們全部人……！”就在他說出最後幾個字的時候，他的皮肉從骨頭上熔化，嘩啦散落一地。"

"The night’s events have left you exhausted. You were unable to learn anything at the Historical Society’s manor that could drive your investigation forward. Whoever those intruders were, they must have been looking for the same information you were. Distraught, you find your way to the closest bed you can find—in Ma’s Boarding House, not too far from the Historical Society. Dawn breaks as you reach the boarding house, the front doorknob and ferns on the porch covered in dew. You are lucky enough to get a vacant room for the day, and soon you are fast asleep.\n"
"Suddenly, you are falling. Above and all around you, a blinding radiance flares like an inferno. Your head twinges with pain and your vision swims with brilliant colors. Your skin is singed by the flames. Below you, the abyss opens and swallows you whole. You then find yourself in a dank, windowless cell, filled with a putrid stench. A man is huddled in a corner of the room, shivering from the cold, or from the hopelessness of his situation, or perhaps both. “No mask,” he mutters over and over, “no mask, no mask…” You take a few tentative steps forward, but before you can reach him, the metal slot on his cell door slides open, and you hear an orderly call to him. “Daniel, it’s time,” he says. “Daniel, wake up. Wake up, Daniel.” Then, you awaken."

"今晚發生的事情讓你筋疲力竭。你在歷史協會這幢宅邸裡一無所獲，調查進度停滯不前。不論那群入侵者是誰，他們要尋找的東西肯定與你要找的一樣。你心煩意亂。只想就近找張床鋪躺下——好在老馬旅社和歷史協會相距不遠。你抵達旅社的時候天已破曉，前門的把手和門廊前的羊齒草上都掛著晨露。幸運的是今天正好有個空房間供你入住，隨後你很快便沉沉睡去。\n"
"突然你整個人在下墜。在你的上方和周圍，閃耀著地獄之火般的光芒，讓你目不能視。你頭痛難當，視線游移，眼前盡是流光溢彩。你的皮肉被火焰燒焦。一張深淵巨口在你下方張開，將你整個人吞了進去。隨後你發覺自己身處在一個潮濕的小房間裡，沒有窗戶，一股腐敗的惡臭味充斥著這裡。一個男人在房間的角落裡瑟瑟發抖，不知是因為寒冷而戰慄，還是說是因為對他的處境無望，或者兩者皆有。“不要面具，”他嘟囔了一遍又一遍，“不要面具，不要面具……”你試探性地向前走了幾步，就在你接近他之前，他的房門上的金屬插槽滑開了，隨後你聽見一個護工對他說話。“丹尼爾，時間到了，”他說道，“丹尼爾，醒醒。給我醒醒，丹尼爾。”然後，你甦醒了。"
