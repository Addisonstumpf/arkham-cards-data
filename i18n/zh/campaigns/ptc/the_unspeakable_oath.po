"“Wake up, Daniel.” The words echo in your thoughts as you pace through the disheveled room, trying to make sense of what you’d just experienced. You had awoken that afternoon with a violent startle, your body shaking, bedsheets soaked with sweat. Although you’d slept a healthy eight-and-a-half hours, you feel even more exhausted than you had the previous night. You catch a glimpse of your dark, bloodshot eyes in the mirror next to the dresser, and wonder if you’ve gotten any real sleep at all.\n"
"Who is Daniel, you wonder? The chamber from your dream looked like a prison, but the man—Daniel—he seemed unhinged, as though he wasn’t in control of his mind. This led to only one conclusion: An asylum. Knowing you’ll get little rest here, you head towards Arkham Asylum, hoping your hunch is correct."

"“給我醒醒，丹尼爾。”就在你穿過一片狼藉的房間，試圖搞清楚方才你到底經歷了什麼的時候，你的腦海中響起了一道聲音。\n"
"你猛然驚醒，汗水濕透了床單，此時已是中午。儘管你睡了足有八個半小時，但你卻感到比前一晚更疲憊。你從梳妝鏡中瞥見自己眼圈烏青，眼睛佈滿血絲，你懷疑自己是不是壓根就沒睡著。\n"
"你滿心疑惑，誰是丹尼爾？你夢中的那個小房間看起來像是監獄，但是那名男子——丹尼爾——他似乎精神失常，頭腦不聽使喚。 只能得出一個推斷：這是一家瘋人院。你知道自己沒法在這好好休息，動身前往阿卡姆瘋人院，但願你的預感是對的。"

"Over the course of the next few days, you delve into the evidence you’ve collected, hoping to find any information regarding Daniel Chesterfield, a stagehand during the previous production of The King in Yellow. As far as you can tell, he is the only surviving member of that production’s cast and crew. The rest of them—that is, those for whom you can find any records at all—disappeared or died soon after opening night in a variety of fashions connected only by their morbidness. Freak accidents. Suicides. Vanishings.\n"
"It would seem that Daniel is your only lead, if you are to investigate further. According to the records you found, he was admitted to Arkham Asylum many years ago. All documentation about Daniel’s treatment seems to end there. You’re unsure if he’s even still alive. Perhaps he was cured and released. You were hoping to avoid this, but there seems to be only one way to find out. You collect your belongings and head downtown, towards Arkham Asylum."

"在接下來的幾天裡，你深入鑽研你所收集到的證據，希望能夠從中找出關於丹尼爾·契斯特菲爾德的信息，他是《黃衣之王》早年演出的一名舞台工作人員。據你所知，他是那場演出的演職人員中唯一的倖存者。而其他的演職人員——所有能在記錄中找到的——在演出當晚之後不久便失蹤或死亡，他們的遇害形式各不相同，但卻都呈現出病態的異常。離奇事故、自殺身亡、憑空消失。\n"
"如果要作進一步的調查，丹尼爾似乎是你唯一的線索了。根據你找到的記錄，他在很多年以前就被送進了阿卡姆瘋人院。在那之後，關於丹尼爾接受治療的文件再無下文。你不知道他現在是否還活著。可能他早已痊癒出院，如果真是這樣的話你的調查將難上加難，但要找到答案只得一種辦法。你收拾行囊，出發前往市中心的阿卡姆瘋人院。"

"As you enter the asylum, you stop to speak with the receptionist, though you feel your body urged to step deeper into the clutches of this madhouse. He gives you a confused expression as you tell him of The King in Yellow and of Daniel. But at your insistence, he pores through his file cabinet, eventually pulling out a stark white folder. Inside is a wealth of information about the patients admitted to the asylum—medical records, psychiatric evaluations, and the like. You recognize a few of the faces as he flips through the pages. “Daniel... Daniel Chesterfield, yes? He is admitted under the special care of Doctor Mintz. But you can’t see him; his level is restricted to staff only.” You argue and insist to be let into the patient wing, knowing that Daniel must hold the key to understanding what is really going on.\n"
"The receptionist gives a pitying smile and relents, nodding to the security guards nearby. “Oh, of course, of course,” he says with all the honesty of a street peddler. “I will schedule a meeting for you with Doctor Mintz so you can speak with him about Daniel. These gentlemen will see you in.” Relieved that you will soon get the answers you seek, you are escorted into the patient wing of Arkham Asylum..."

"當你步入瘋人院時，你停下腳步與接待員談話，但你感覺你的身體在驅使著你一步一步邁向瘋子的聚居地。你向接待員提到《黃衣之王》和丹尼爾時，他的臉龐上流露出困惑的表情。但是在你的堅持之下，他從檔案櫃裡一番好找，終於找出一個樣式簡陋的白色文件夾。裡面有著病人的許多資料——病例，精神評估報告等等。就在他翻頁時，你認出了幾張面孔。“丹尼爾……丹尼爾·契斯特菲爾德，對嗎？他是在明茨醫生的特殊護理下收容入院的。但你不能見他；他當前的級別只允許醫院員工進行探視。”你與他爭辯起來，堅持要進入病房大樓，因為你堅信丹尼爾掌握著通向真相的門匙，找到他你才能明白這一切。\n"
"接待員憐憫地笑笑，態度變得緩和，他向旁邊的警衛點了點頭。“噢，當然，當然，”他帶有街頭小販般懇切的口氣。“我會安排你與明茨醫生會面，到時你就可以問他有關丹尼爾的事情了。這幾位先生會領你進去的。”你馬上就會得到你所追尋的答案，不由得放下心來，在護送之下走進了阿卡姆瘋人院的病房大樓。"

msgid "You recall what Constance had told you when you spoke with her during her hellish dinner party. She and the other members of the cast and crew had been told by the director, Nigel Engram, to take some kind of oath. At first, she’d written it off as the whim of an eccentric artist; something Mr. Engram did as a strange formality to unite and strengthen the bonds of the cast and crew. And to his credit, she claimed that it had worked; ever since they’d taken his strange oath, she and the other members of the troupe felt much more confident and full of spirit. Perhaps Daniel had a similar experience during the last production of <u>The King in Yellow</u>. You must speak with him about this."
msgstr "你回想起康斯坦絲在她那地獄般的宴會上告訴你的事情。導演奈傑爾‧英格蘭姆曾告訴她和其他的演職人員要進行某種宣誓。一開始，她將這看作是怪人藝術家的心血來潮；英格蘭姆先生所做的或許是一種奇怪的儀式，用來加強演職人員之間的關係，使大家團結起來。她聲稱這確實有效，值得對導演大加褒獎；自從他們宣讀導演那奇怪的誓言之後，她和劇團的其他成員感到更加自信，並且富有活力。或許丹尼爾在上一次的《黃衣之王》演出中也有相同的經歷。你得跟他談談這事。"

"“Doctor Mintz, the patient has been medicated and is ready to see you now.” Nurse Heather opened the file on the desk nearby, taking a moment to review the patient’s records.\n"
"“Any changes in the patient’s condition?” Doctor Mintz asked in a monotone voice. A formality. Both knew the patient was beyond repair.\n"
"“None. The patient’s delusions remain. Demanding to speak with the Warden, claiming they are only guests, and rambling about that play that aired the other night, <u>The King in Yellow</u>.”\n"
"“And their other crimes? The incident in the theatre? What about 1452 Atlantic Ave?”\n"
"“They believe they were attacked, and were defending themselves.” Her voice was thick with pity. What could have caused somebody to snap like this so quickly? None of the patient’s records showed any prior history of mental instability. “Can you make any sense of it, Doctor?”\n"
"“Who could?” Doctor Mintz sighed and stood, grabbing the file from his desk. “My job is not to understand. It is to cure. Perhaps my experimental procedures will prove fruitful on this one.” The nurse winced and felt goosebumps on her arm. She knew how his procedures would turn out, and she doubted it would prove anything."

"“病人認為自己遭到襲擊並且作出了自衛。”她的聲音充滿了憐憫。是什麼能導致人作出如此迅猛的撕咬動作？這個病人從來沒有精神不穩定的病史。“您有頭緒嗎，醫生？”\n"
"“沒有。”明茨醫生嘆氣並站起身，拿起桌上的文件。“我的職責是治病，而不是去搞懂病人的想法。或許我的實驗療法會對這種病情有所幫助。”護士的身體不由得退縮，她感覺到手臂上冒出了雞皮疙瘩。她非常清楚醫生所說的療法是什麼，並且十分懷疑那種療法是否能起到任何的作用。"
