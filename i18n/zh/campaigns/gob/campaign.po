msgid "While not an official variant, some people like to play the two scenarions included in the Guardians of the Abyss expansion as a two scenario mini-campaign. Because this is an unofficial variant, note that you might want to utilize standalone deckbuilding rules, since the product was intended to be played with decks with some amount of XP."
msgstr "儘管官方無此變體，但一些人喜歡將深淵守衛擴充(含兩場冒險)當作一個包含兩場冒險的迷你劇本。因為這是一種非官方變體的玩法，且此擴充原本是設計給已經取得一些經驗的牌組來進行，你也許會想採用獨立擴充包的牌組構建規則(以降低難度)。"
