msgstr "幕間故事II：無盡夜晚"

msgid "Once again safe, you and your companions set up camp in silence. You marvel at how much quieter the evening is compared to those that came before, be it due to your dwindling numbers or the grim mood that hangs over the camp. But the quiet is anything but peaceful. As the hours pass, you can't seem to get any rest. You decide instead to check on your companions…"
msgstr "再一次安全了，你和你的同伴沉默地搭建營地。你驚奇地發現，與之前相比，今夜安靜多了，這可能是由於你們人數的減少，也可能是由於籠罩在營地上空的陰鬱情緒。但這裡的安靜絕不代表和平。隨著時間的流逝，你似乎得不到任何休息。你決定去看看你的同伴……"

msgid "You only have enough time to check on a few team members (regardless of whether they are alive or crossed out). One at a time, choose and read three of the sections below (four instead if <i>the team found another way through the mountains</i>). If the game effect of the chosen section cannot be performed, it does not count toward this total and you may choose a new section instead."
msgstr "你只有一點時間去查看幾名隊員(無論他們是活著還是被劃掉)。每次選擇以下一個部分閱讀，一共三次(如果<i>隊伍找到另一條路穿過山脈</i>，改為四次)。如果所選擇的部分的遊戲效果不能執 行，則這次選擇不計數，你可以改為再選擇一個新的部分。"

msgid "If William Dyer is alive:"
msgstr "如果威廉·戴爾活著："

msgid "The professor paces back and forth, running his fingers through his graying hair. “They are connected. They must be connected,” he rambles to himself as you approach. “The Elder Things and these manifestations, these ‘mirages’,” he continues, as if to answer your unspoken question. “When we were here last, I saw images of the Elder Things in conflict with other species, other… alien beings. But what if the true source of their fear lies here on Earth?” His gaze meets yours. “What if this wasn't their true home? What if… what if they were guarding something?”"
msgstr "教授來回踱步，用手指梳理著他灰白的頭髮。“它們是有聯繫的。它們一定是有聯繫的。”你走近時，他正在自言自語，“古老者和這些顯現，這些‘幻景’。”他繼續說著，好像在回答你沒有問出口的問題。“我們上次到這兒的時候，我看到了古老者與其他種族，其他……異形生物發生衝突的畫面。但如果它們恐懼的真正源頭就在地球上呢？”他凝視著你的眼睛。“如果這兒不是它們真正的家園呢？如果……如果它們是在看守什麼東西呢？”"

msgid "Does any investigator's deck contain one or more Tekeli-li weaknesses?"
msgstr "有調查員的牌組中有一張或更多的忒咳哩-哩弱點嗎？"

msgid "Speaking with Professor Dyer helps you to see reason within this madness. Any one investigator may choose and remove up to five Tekeli-li! weaknesses from their deck <i>(shuffling them with the remainder of the Tekeli-li encounter set)</i>."
msgstr "與戴爾教授交談使你窺見這瘋狂中的理性。任意一位調查員可以選擇並移除其牌組中最多5張忒咳哩-哩！弱點<i>(將它們與忒咳哩-哩遭遇組中的剩餘卡牌混洗在一起)</i>。"

msgid "Note this change in the app when upgrading decks at the end of this interlude."
msgstr "在幕間故事結尾更新牌組時，將此變化標註在APP裡。"

msgid "Because no investigator's deck contains any Tekeli-li! weaknesses, you may choose an additional conversation."
msgstr "因為沒有調查員的牌組中有忒咳哩-哩！弱點，你可以選擇閱讀一個額外的對話。"

msgid "You take a moment to pore through some of the professor’s old sketches, which he brought with him in the event they might prove useful. As you suspected, none of the creatures he depicted look anything like the things you saw. But just as you are about to give up, you find several sketches of the city he claims to have found beyond the dark, jagged mountains. These depict an enormous archway emblazoned with five glyphs surrounded by a five-pointed star. Below the archway—or perhaps behind it—looms something grotesque. The lines of the sketch disintegrate into a tangle of light strokes and splotches of ink you can scarcely describe. Several more creatures with barrel-shaped bodies and starfish-like heads—the alien “Elder Things” Dyer described in his report—flank the archway, looking on reverently, their wing-like appendages spread forth in reverence. You wish you could ask Dyer himself what this may mean, but sadly, it’s too late for that. You collect his sketches and bring them with you, hoping they might come in handy later."
msgstr "你花了點時間仔細研究了教授以前畫的一些素描，他把這些素描都帶著，以防萬一會用到。正如你所猜想的，他所描繪的生物和你見到的東西沒有任何相似之處。但就在你準備放棄的時候，你發現了幾張他聲稱在鋸齒狀的黑色山脈後面發現的城市的草圖。這些圖描繪了一個巨大的拱門，上面裝飾著五個象形文字，圍繞著一個五角星。拱門下面——或者拱門後面——隱現著一些怪誕的東西。素描的線條化成一團亂麻的筆觸和難以形容的墨漬。而更多有著桶形身體和海星狀頭部的生物——戴爾在他的報告中描述的外星人“古老者”——站在拱門側面，虔誠地看著，它們翅膀一樣的附屬肢體伸展開來以示尊敬。你很希望你還能夠向戴爾詢問這意味著什麼，但遺憾的是已經太遲了。你收集了他的素描並隨身攜帶，希望以後能派上用場。"

msgid "If Danforth is alive:"
msgstr "如果丹佛斯活著："

msgid "Nobody else seems to understand Danforth’s ramblings, but you think you're starting to. Or, at the very least, you're the only one trying. After all, whatever he saw during the last journey here, it lies at the heart of all of this. “It was… it…” he pauses, his voice hitching as he tries to explain. “It was like the creatures we’ve seen. Ink, mist, and color. Or, at least, I think that the only way our human eyes might interpret their true shape.” His own eyes are distant, glazed over with horror as he reimagines the mirage. “It is still here. Bound, shackled. But not for long, I fear. Not for long.”"
msgstr "似乎沒人理解丹佛斯的胡言亂語，但你覺得你開始明白了。或者至少，你是唯一一個在努力的人。畢竟，無論他在上次旅程中看到了什麼，那都是這一切的核心。“它是……它……”他停頓了，試圖解釋但聲音哽咽。“它就像我們見到過的那種生物。墨色、霧狀，還五彩繽紛。或者至少，我認為，這是我們人類的眼睛能夠瞭解它們真實形狀的唯一辦法。”當他回想那幻景時，他的眼神由於恐懼，顯得空洞而遙遠。“它還在這裡。被約束、束縛著。但我恐怕已經不會太久了。不會太久了。”"

msgid "Listening to Danforth gives you further insight into the madness of this place. Any one investigator may begin <b>Scenario III: City of the Elder Things</b> with two additional cards drawn in their opening hand."
msgstr "聽丹佛斯的一番話使你更深入洞悉了此地的瘋狂。任意一位調查員可以在開始<b>冒險III：古老者之城</b>的時候額外有兩張起始手牌。"

msgid "You decide to seek wisdom in Danforth’s belongings, hoping he kept a journal or some evidence from his prior expedition with Dyer. What you find instead is a treasure trove of fiction both macabre and speculative, including a well-worn copy of the works of Edgar Allan Poe. Its pages are punctuated by many makeshift tabs, and its margins inscribed with many notes and jottings—some relevant, others whose true meaning eludes you. You’re not sure why Danforth thought there was any reason to bring such a collection of tales, most especially one so beloved to him. You open it to one of the tabbed pages and read: “He could not be prevailed upon to touch it or go near it, shuddering when we attempted to force him, and shrieking out, ‘Tekeli-li!’” In the margins, Danforth has scribbled: “What could force one out of such paroxysm? How can I leave this dreadful feeling behind?”"
msgstr "你決定從丹佛斯的遺物中尋找智慧，希望他有日記或者一些他之前和戴爾一起探險的證據。但你發現的卻是一個既可怕又稀奇古怪的小說寶庫。其中包括一本老舊的愛德格·愛倫·坡作品集。它的書頁上有許多臨時的標籤，頁邊寫著許多筆記——有些是相關的，有些是你無法理解其真正含義的。你不清楚為什麼丹佛斯認為他有理由把這麼多小說帶著，特別是他這麼喜歡的一本。你打開到一個標籤頁，讀道：“我們無法說服他去觸摸它或接近它，而當我們試圖強迫他時，他開始顫抖，並尖叫著‘忒咳哩-哩！’。”在書的空白處，丹佛斯草草寫下：“是什麼能使一個人突然這樣爆走呢？我該怎樣才能把這種可怕的感覺拋在腦後呢？”"

msgstr "如果艾米·肯斯勒博士活著，但在劇本日誌中並未記錄著<i>肯斯勒博士與你分享她的研究</i>："

msgid "Dr. Kensler is unsurprised when you enter her tent. She looks up from her desk and tilts her glasses down to gaze at you directly. “Here to inquire after my findings?” she asks, to which you nod. “Very well.” You note her unusually warm demeanor as you approach and peer over her shoulder. In front of her, a section of one of an Elder Thing's limbs is dissected with expert precision. Dark green liquid stains its scaly flesh and the surface beneath it alike. She raises her glasses once again and turns to face her anatomical sample. “It's not unlike us,” she says, “just as Dyer suggested in his own account. And yet, somehow, they are able to survive incredible pressure and cold. Perhaps even the vacuum of space. What I don't understand is …” she breathes deep, and continues. “Dyer's report only accounts for the waking of a few of these creatures from their hibernation. Why, then, are so many of them active?”"
msgstr "當你進入肯斯勒博士的帳篷時，她並不驚訝。她從桌子上抬起頭來，拿下眼鏡直視著你。“來打聽我的發現嗎？”她問道，你點點頭。“好吧。”當你走近她，越過肩膀看向她後方時，你注意到她異常熱情。在她面前，一個古老者肢體的一部分被精確解剖了。深綠色的液體污染了它鱗片狀的皮膚與下方的表面。她再次抬起眼鏡，轉向她的解剖樣本。“它和我們沒什麼不同。”她說，“正如戴爾在他自己的描述中提出的。然而，不知為何，它們能夠在難以置信的壓力和寒冷中生存。甚至宇宙真空環境中也可能存活。我不明白的是……”她深深吸了口氣，繼續說，戴爾的報告提到這些生物只有一部分從冬眠中蘇醒。那麼，為何現在卻有如此多的活躍數量？”"

msgstr "當你進入肯斯勒博士的帳篷時，她冷冷地看了你一眼，然後繼續她的工作。“對不起，我太忙了，沒空照顧你那瑣碎的事，我可沒有時間磨蹭。你去找別人聊天吧，我要繼續我的工作。”"

"You survey the research notes left behind by the leader of this doomed expedition. Surely, if anyone could make some sense out of what you’ve seen so far, it would be Dr. Kensler. Perhaps she knew more about these creatures than she let on. You scour her tent and filter through her belongings until you come across a thick journal filled with meticulous notes regarding the journey to Antarctica and the first couple days you spent unloading supplies and setting up camp. From there, the notes become less detailed and more jumbled. Her recounting of the days leading up to the plane crash is less a well-kept diary and more a delirious tangent. She wrote of walls dripping with black miasma, an endless void beneath the ice, something evil and alien that dwelled at the core beyond the gateway—and then, nothing.\n"
"Dr. Kensler had not been one to recount dreams or author works of fiction. Something had rattled her. Something had made her see the things of which she wrote. But how? And when? You sit and continue her documentation with your own record of events, hoping grimly that if you don’t make it off this continent alive, someone will read this and know what transpired here…"

You had come to her expecting a roll of her eyes and a scolding over your condition. “Oh, come on. I'm not allowed to worry? After everything we've seen and been through, I think I'm overdue a bit of fretting.” At her insistance, you allow her to examine you for wounds and early signs of hypothermia. “We're lucky to still be alive you know,” she says quietly as she unpacks her medical kit. “Or maybe…” she clicks her teeth, and shakes her head. “…maybe they're the lucky ones.”"

Still, perhaps you can salvage some use out of her old medical kits and cold-weather gear. As you stuff her medical supplies into one of her backpacks, a shiver crawls up your back. You tell yourself it is out of necessity, but helping yourself to the belongings of the dead still weighs heavily on your conscience. You heft the backpack straps onto your shoulders and turn to leave Dr. Sinha’s tent, hoping to put this grim business out of mind. The quiet clatter of something falling out of the backpack’s front pocket catches your attention. You search around your feet for the object and find a small leather wallet containing only a hairpin, a picture of Dr. Sinha with what you can only assume to be her family, and a ticket stub for a show at the Riverview Theatre. Without truly thinking why, you pocket it. If it was important enough for her to keep, it must hold some sentiment."

You shake your head and inform him that you're just here for the companionship. “Sure, sure. Can't sleep, more like,” he accuses. You say nothing in response. You cannot refute the truth. He takes a long, hard breath, then goes on. “When we were in the trenches, we almost never slept. It was hard enough in those conditions, in the dirt and mud, covered in flies. And anytime we tried, the Germans would wake us up with mortar fire. The exhaustion was unbearable.” His stare burns into the fire. “Even an hour or two was a godsend.

Inside are several of Cookie’s personal effects—a pocketwatch with a cracked face, a matchbook emblazoned with the logo of the Excelsior Hotel, and of course his trusty .32 Colt revolver. It is exceptionally well-maintained, its barrel polished clean and its wooden grip immaculate. Knowing Cookie, it had less to do with his love of the thing and more to do with old habits dying hard.

msgid "If you didn’t know any better, you’d assume Ellsworth had been preparing for the apocalypse. Despite his reputation as a light‑footed explorer and expert backpacker, a cursory glance at the belongings he left behind provides a wealth of provisions, supplies, and cold-weather gear. As the team mournfully divides his things so as to put them to good use, you spot an extra pair of water-resistant boots he must have brought along as backup. You don’t know if any of you could truly follow in his footsteps, but at least with these you might be able to walk in his shoes."

You spend several minutes poring through her belongings in search of anything that might be of value to the remaining members of the expedition. Without Takada, you won’t be able to put the final aeroplane in flying shape. In fact, you imagine you’ll be forced to leave most of her things behind when you make for the mountains tomorrow.

Anyu has helped me through a lot of situations like… well, I suppose I have never quite been in a situation like this. But she has always been there for me. And she seems to have taken a particular liking to you, too.” As if she understands Eliyah's words, the dog gazes at you warmly. You smile again and tell her that you feel the same way.

You shake your head and rise, heavy, to your feet. That’s enough mourning for one night. As you venture back to camp, soft footfalls trail through the snow just behind you. You stop and glance at Anyu. Once again, she looks up to meet your gaze. Is she looking for comfort, or guidance? You kneel and run your gloved fingers through her thick fur, speaking soothingly to reassure the both of you. Yes, Eliyah is gone. No, I don’t know if we are safe, either.
