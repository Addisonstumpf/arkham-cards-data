"It has been a long eight weeks since you left Boston, and not without its toil. The Theodosia followed much the same route as its predecessors, the Arkham and the Miskatonic—first sailing southward along the east coast and through the Panama Canal, before venturing toward the Antarctic Circle. As the weather grew steadily colder, icebergs became more and more of a problem for the ship to navigate, but with the crew's expertise and the logs of the previous captains who made this same journey, you make good time. Soon enough, you spy the mist-covered peaks of Mts. Erebus and Terror ahead, marking the site of Ross Island, near the ice shelf that will serve as the expedition's landing spot.\n"
"As you approach the coast, Dr. Kensler and the rest of the team meet aboard the deck of the Theodosia to discuss your plans. \"We'll use the same breeches-buoy system as before to unload supplies onto the ice shelf,\" she explains. \"Mr. Fredericks, Mr. Ellsworth, and Mr. Claypool, you'll be taking one of our smaller boats to the shelf to find us a landing zone. Ms. Takada, once we have a camp up and running, those aeroplanes are your first priority. Mr. Ashevak, I expect those sledges to help move supplies from the landing to camp. As soon as we reach the ice shelf, there's going to be a lot of work to get done in a short time. I don't want you to have to wrangle three dozen dogs on top of all that. So get them in order.\"\n"
"Eliyah rolls his eyes and idly pets Anyu, who sits diligently by his side. \"Yes ma'am.\"\n"
"Professor Dyer speaks up. \"I suspect the lack of ice-melting and boring equipment means we aren't taking any mineral samples?\" he asks rhetorically.\n"
"Dr. Kensler shakes her head. \"No need, although if we happen to find a suitable piece, we might as well claim it. That said, our mission is solely to corroborate the findings you made with Danforth, and to bring back more evidence of this ancient species, these 'Elder Things,' as you dubbed them. A living specimen would be ideal, of course… such a strange and alien beast, trapped in ice throughout the ages—it would be like discovering a live woolly mammoth, I imagine.\"\n"
"He balks at that. \"A living specimen? You do know these things killed several of Lake's men, right? And how do you propose we capture one, exactly?\"\n"
"She blinks. \"You're the expert, William. You tell me.\"\n"
"Dyer walks off, shaking his head and muttering angrily. \"I knew this was a bad idea…\"\n"
"\"All right, you all have your assignments. We will reach land within the hour. Be ready,\" Dr. Kensler says, dismissing the meeting. Before she can go below deck, you approach and remark that you aren't sure what you should be doing just yet.\n"
"\"Oh, there will be enough manual labor to go around,\" she replies with the hint of a smirk."

"自從離開波士頓，已經過了漫長的八周，同時也不乏一路上的勞頓。菲奧多西亞號基本遵循了它的前輩，阿卡姆號與米斯卡塔尼克號的路線——首先沿著東海岸向南航行，穿過巴拿馬運河，然後向南極圈進發。隨著天氣持續變冷，冰山對航行的阻撓越來越大，但根據船員的專業知識，以及之前進行過同樣旅程的船長的記錄，你們順風順水。很快，你就在前方發現了迷霧籠罩的埃里伯斯火山和特羅爾山，標示著那裡是羅斯島，距離探險隊的登陸點所在的冰架已經不遠了。\n"
"當你們接近海岸時，肯斯勒博士和其他隊員在菲奧多西亞號的甲板上聚集，討論著計畫。“我們會使用與之前一樣的雙筒救生圈系統，將物資卸到冰架上。”她解釋道，“弗雷德里克斯先生、埃爾斯沃思先生，以及克萊普爾先生，你們要用我們的一艘小船到達冰架那，為我們尋找一個登陸區域。高田女士，一旦我們建起營地並開始運作，飛機就是你的首要任務。阿什瓦克先生，我希望這些雪橇能幫助我們將補給從登陸點運到營地。我們一到達冰架，在短時間內就會有很多工作要做。我可不希望你再和三十幾條狗糾纏在一起。請控制好它們。”\n"
"伊里亞翻了個白眼，漫不經心地撫弄著坐在他身邊的安雨。“是的，長官。”\n"
"戴爾教授此時發言：“我們缺少融冰設備和鑽孔設備，是不是說明我們不打算採集任何礦物樣本？”他委婉地問道。\n"
"肯斯勒博士搖頭。“不需要，不過如果我們正好碰到合適的碎片，我們也可以順便採集。也就是說，我們的任務僅僅是要證實你和丹佛斯的發現，帶回更多關於這個古老物種的證據，也就是你口中的“古老者”。當然，最好能得到活生生的樣本……如此古怪、奇異的生物，被困於冰中直至今日——我想，這就像發現一隻活的長毛象一樣。 ”\n"
"他聽到這話畏縮了一下。“活的樣本？你應該知道這種東西殺了多少萊克的人吧？而且你具體打算怎麼活捉一隻？”\n"
"她眨了眨眼睛。“威廉，你才是專家。你來想辦法吧。”\n"
"戴爾搖搖頭，憤憤地嘟囔著走開了。“我就知道這是個壞主意……”\n"
"“好了，你們現在都安排好了。我們將在一小時內到達陸地。都準備好。”肯斯勒博士說完，結束了會議。在她走下甲板之前，你靠近她，表示你還不知道你該做什麼。\n"
"“噢，有的是苦力活等著你。”她回答道，露出一絲得意的笑容。"
