"\"I am forced into speech because men of science have refused to follow my advice without knowing why. It is altogether against my will that I tell my reasons for opposing this contemplated invasion of the antarctic—with its vast fossil-hunt and its wholesale boring and melting of the ancient ice-cap—and I am the more reluctant because my warning may be in vain. Doubt of the real facts, as I must reveal them, is inevitable; yet if I suppressed what will seem extravagant and incredible there would be nothing left.\"\n"

"\"You understand now, yes? Why this expedition must be stopped?\" Professor William Dyer sits across from you at his office desk. A wealth of academic papers and scientific journals lies sprawled between you, including Dyer’s own lengthy account of his journey to the Antarctic. Up until the publication of this revised report—the alleged \"truth\"—the university’s last expedition to Antarctica yielded very little in the way of scientific discoveries.\n"
"At Dyer’s request, you’d read through this new report of what really happened beyond those \"Mountains of Madness,\" as he had dubbed them. You scarcely would have believed any of it were it not for the bevy of photographs and drawings that came along with it: evidence of mangled, dissected bodies; of perplexing five-pointed snow graves; of strange specimens found half-buried in the ice; and, finally, aerial shots of the jagged black peaks described in Dyer’s tale.\n"
"Dyer has called on you to help convince his colleagues to abandon their planned follow-up expedition. His student, Danforth—the only other member of the expedition to reach the alien stone-city described in Dyer’s report—paces back and forth by the entrance to Dyer’s office, muttering nonsensically to himself while you consider their strange tale.\n"
"You’re still unsure what to make of all this. On the one hand, Dyer’s concern seems genuine, and his account is filled with such detail and specificity that you find it difficult to doubt its authenticity. And yet, there’s no way it could all be true. An ancient city in the ice, built by primordial beings? So-called \"Elder Things\"? How could such things be real? Danforth mumbles something about a nameless black pit as you place Dyer’s report back on his desk. The professor gazes at you with sleepless, bloodshot eyes. \"Well?\" Dyer asks. \"Will you help us stop this madness? Will you make them see reason?\""

"“現在你明白了吧？為什麼必須中止這次探險？”威廉·戴爾教授和你面對面坐在他的辦公桌前。你們中間散落著大量學術論文和科學期刊，包括戴爾自己對南極之旅的長篇敘述。在這份修訂後的報告——所謂的“真相”——發表之前，大學對南極洲的最近一次考察在科學發現方面都收效甚微。\n"
"在戴爾的要求下，你閱讀了這些新的報告，關於那些他稱之為“瘋狂山脈”另一邊的真實情況。如果沒有報告附帶的那些照片和圖畫，你幾乎不會相信這一切。這些證據包括：被肢解的殘破屍體；令人費解的五角形雪塚；半埋在雪裡的奇怪標本；以及最後，從空中拍攝的、在戴爾的故事中所描述的那鋸齒狀的黑色山峰。\n"
"戴爾請你幫助他說服他的同事，放棄他們計畫中的後續探險。在你思考著他們離奇的故事時，他的學生丹佛斯——在戴爾的報告中，是上次探險中唯一一個和他到達了異形石城的其他成員——正在辦公室門口來回踱步，嘴裡自言自語的講一些胡話。\n"
"你仍然不確定這一切是怎麼回事。一方面，戴爾似乎是真的很擔心，他的敘述充斥著如此詳盡的細節和特徵，你很難懷疑它的真實性。然而，這也不可能都是真的。一座由原始生物建造的冰雪中的古老城市？所謂的“古老者”？這種事情怎麼可能是真的呢？在你將戴爾的報告放回他桌上時，丹佛斯咕噥著什麼無名黑坑。教授用失眠充血的眼睛盯著你。“怎麼樣？”戴爾問道，“你能幫我們阻止這瘋狂嗎？你能讓他們明白嗎？”"

"Dyer lets out an anxious breath and relents. \"I suppose I might have said the same thing, once. But now, after what I’ve seen…\" A shudder courses through the man’s aging body. \"You are venturing somewhere humanity does not belong. I am starting to believe that scholars such as ourselves can only continue to probe the depths of science for so long before we are laid low by what we find.\"\n"
"\"Or by what finds us,\" Danforth chimes from behind.\n"
"Dyer glances at his student, studying his expression, then turns his attention back to you. \"If you go on this journey with Dr. Kensler, the lot of you may not ever return. Will you not reconsider?\"\n"
"You explain that while there is surely significant danger in your expedition, Dr. Amy Kensler—the scientist leading this new trek to Antarctica—has taken precautions to ensure it does not meet the same end as Dyer’s. More importantly, it is the only way to understand the threats they encountered, and the only way to prepare if such threats are unearthed by other, less cautious scientists.\n"
"\"Yes, I… I confess I had that same worry,\" he replies. \"We are unlikely to convince the greater scientific community, I’m afraid. Perhaps it would be better to… to return, and learn more about what we saw…\"\n"
"Danforth nods. \"I agree. How do we know what we saw is anything more than the overactive imaginings of two explorers with a queer fascination for the bizarre and macabre? Of Arthur Gordon Pym’s ill-fated journeys?\"\n"
"Dyer’s eyes narrow at his student. The knowledge reflected in his dark eyes chills you to your core. \"You say such things, and yet, I daresay you did not see what I saw.\"\n"
"The student scoffs. \"You are not the one who glimpsed that mirage at the edge of the mountainside—\"\n"
"\"I am not referring to the ‘mirage,’ Danforth; I am referring to what I saw in you,\" Dyer retorts. \"The things you said on that aeroplane, the look on your face… I’ll never forget.\" Silence pervades the room as Danforth returns to his corner to languish in his own doubt.\n"
"Dyer pleads with you. \"Whatever the case may be, is there nothing I can say to deter you?\" You ponder for a brief moment, then shake your head. There is too much at stake—especially if Dyer’s account turns out to be the truth.\n"
"\"All right, then,\" Dyer concludes with a sigh. \"Since you lot have no clue what you are getting into, I suppose we have no choice but to come, too. You can tell Dr. Kensler that she wins. We will be ready to leave within the week.\"\n"
"You shake his hand and make for the door. \"I hope, for all our sakes, that Danforth is right,\" he adds before you are out of earshot."

"戴爾長舒一口氣，平靜了下來。“以前的我可能也會這麼說。但是現在，在我看到過……”他衰老的身體一陣顫慄。“你在不屬於人類的地方冒險。我開始相信，像我們這樣的學者，只能在科學的深淵探索一陣，然後就會被我們發現的東西壓垮。\n"
"“或者被發現我們的東西壓垮。”丹佛斯在後面插話道。\n"
"戴爾瞥了他的學生一眼，琢磨了一下他的表情，然後把注意力轉回你身上。“如果你隨同肯斯勒博士一同踏上這次旅途，很可能全員有去無回。你不再考慮一下嗎？”\n"
"你解釋說，雖然你們的探險肯定會有重大的危險，但艾米·肯斯勒博士——帶領這次新的南極之旅的科學家——已經採取了預防措施，確保不會出現像戴爾那次一樣的結局。更重要的是，這是瞭解他們遭遇到的威脅的唯一方式，也是在這些威脅被其他缺乏謹慎的科學家發現前作好準備的唯一方式。\n"
"“是的，我……我承認我也有同樣的顧慮。”他回答道，“恐怕我們無法說服整個科學界。也許回去更多瞭解那些我們所看到的……會更好……”\n"
"丹佛斯點頭。“我同意。我們怎麼知道我們看到的也許只是兩個對怪誕和恐怖過於著迷的探險家的異想天開呢？就像亞瑟·戈登·皮姆的不幸之旅？”\n"

"“我指的不是‘幻景’，丹佛斯；我指的是我在你身上看到的東西。”戴爾反駁，“你在飛機上說的那些話，你當時的表情……我永遠不會忘記。”丹佛斯回到他的角落苦思他自己的疑問，房內一片寂靜。\n"
"戴爾懇求你。“無論事態會如何發展，無論我說什麼都無法阻止你了嗎？”你想了一會兒，然後搖搖頭。有太多的利害關係——特別是如果戴爾的敘述被證明是真實的話。\n"

"Dyer’s jaw clenches and his cheeks redden. For a moment he looks as though he is about to slam his fist on the desk between the two of you, but after a moment of consideration, he takes a deep breath and shakes his head. \"I suppose to any reasonable person it should seem that way. Perhaps my faith in the scientific community was misplaced. Of course Dr. Kensler would not believe me, not even with all this evidence.\" He shoves several of the photographs on his desk aside in frustration.\n"
"You explain that Dr. Amy Kensler—the scientist leading this new trek to Antarctica—is motivated by genuine academic curiosity, rather than greed or glory.\n"
"\"It matters not,\" Dyer remarks bitterly. \"Even so, she seeks more evidence of my findings, despite my warnings. And so the cycle continues. Perhaps science itself is naught but folly. We are but silly little mice under glass, seeking escape for our own sake, with little understanding of what lies beyond our cage.\"\n"

"你解釋說，艾米·肯斯勒博士——帶領這次新的南極之旅的科學家——的動機是純粹的學術好奇心，而不是貪婪或榮譽。\n"
"“這不重要。”戴爾痛苦地說，“儘管如此，她還是不顧我的警告，想要尋求更多證據來證明我的發現。如此就成了不斷迴圈。也許科學本身就是愚蠢的。我們不過是玻璃下盲目的老鼠，為了自己想要逃出去，卻對籠子外面的世界一無所知。”\n"

"Standing in front of the plankway leading up to the deck of the Theodosia is <minicaps>Dr. Amy Kensler</minicaps>. A professor of Biology at Miskatonic University, the no-nonsense scientist has been a fixture of the university’s Sciences department for over a decade. Without so much as peering up from her clipboard, she crosses off your name as you approach. \"Good of you to make it on time. Mr. Ellsworth here will take your luggage aboard.\"\n"
"\"Oh, I will, will I?\" the man standing next to her replies with a chuckle. He offers you his hand in introduction, and you shake it. \"<minicaps>Roald Ellsworth</minicaps>, at your service.\"\n"
"By way of introduction, Dr. Kensler explains, \"Mr Ellsworth has been on over a dozen expeditions and comes highly recommended. I’m sure his expertise will be invaluable in the weeks to come.\"\n"
"Ellsworth rolls his eyes. \"His expertise, yes… and his willingness to be used as manual labor!\" he adds with a chuckle as he hefts your luggage and takes it up the plankway.\n"
"\"Come on, Ellsworth!\" shouts another voice from inside the ship. A gruff-looking man with a thick brown beard emerges, motioning for Ellsworth to hurry. \"We got a ton ‘o work to get done before we embark!\"\n"
"\"A little busy, Cookie,\" Ellsworth shouts back in reply. Then he turns back to you and remarks over his shoulder: \"Do not mind him. Cookie is a bit of an intense fellow, but he is all right.\"\n"
"\"The name’s Fredericks,\" the gruff man barks back. \"<minicaps>James Fredericks</minicaps>. I swear, sometimes I think I’m the only one here who’s ready for this damned trip,\" he mutters angrily. \"An’ didn’t anyone ever tell yeh it’s bad luck to name a ship after someone who died at sea?\"\n"
"Another voice calls down from the deck of the ship: \"Cookie, if you could be so kind as to lower your voice, some of us are trying to work up here.\" The man responds with a grunt and ducks back inside the ship, rolling his eyes. You crane your head upwards and see a young woman leaning over the railing of the ship’s deck, her long brown hair tied in a thick ponytail that dangles around her neck. \"Hey! You made it,\" she calls out to you. \"Dr. Kensler was pretty excited that you’re coming along. Looking forward to working with you.\"\n"
"Without looking up from her clipboard, Dr. Kensler mumbles. \"Ms. <minicaps>Takada Hiroko</minicaps> is our aeroplane mechanic. As with the previous expedition, we will be constructing our planes onsite. No need to worry—she may be one of the youngest in her field, but she knows what she is doing.\"\n"
"More of the crew begin to arrive, one by one. The first is a man in his 30s with a wispy blonde beard and bright green eyes. \"Mr. <minicaps>Avery Claypool</minicaps>,\" Dr. Kensler introduces you to the man, and the two of you shake hands. \"Mr. Claypool is an…associate…of Mr. Ellsworth’s. He will be serving as our guide in the Antarctic.\"\n"
"\"Weather permitting,\" Claypool jokes. \"Honestly, we will be lucky if we can even get off the ice shelf.\"\n"
"\"I am confident with your skills we will make it as far as Dyer and Lake did.\"\n"
"\"That is what I am afraid of,\" Claypool mutters, walking briskly past Kensler and up the plankway. On his way up, he passes Ellsworth, and the two freeze, locking eyes. You could swear that the temperature lowers several degrees as the two brush by one another without a single word.\n"
"\"They are usually on…better terms,\" Dr. Kensler says under her breath, \"but recently fell into some issue or another. They had better learn to live with their differences. They will be unable to avoid one another for quite some time, after all.\" You watch as Claypool’s gaze wanders back to Ellsworth for just a fraction of a second before he turns away angrily and enters the ship.\n"
"The next to arrive is a woman with warm brown skin and weary eyes. Along with her luggage, she carries a rather large, bright-red medical kit emblazoned with a white cross. She extends her hand, and you cannot help but notice the nervous tremble in Dr. Kensler's hand as she shakes it. \"Thank you for joining us on this voyage, Mala.\"\n"
"\"Oh, Amy. Somebody has to keep you alive,\" she replies. There is a moment of awkward silence as Dr. Kensler glances up at the woman, then down at her feet, her cheeks tinged red. \"Right. Well, then,\" she remarks, and continues up the walkway.\n"
"Dr.Kensler clears her throat once she is out of earshot. \"<minicaps>Dr. Mala Sinha</minicaps> is our physician,\" she explains. \"It took some convincing to get her to join us, so try not to abuse her expertise with inconsequential problems. Frostbite will be a very real concern, as will gangrene and hypothermia. Try to stay on her good side.\" You're unsure if Dr. Kensler is joking.\n"
"A man's voice pierces the sudden silence, along with the clamor of a dog barking. \"Anyu! Dammit, Anyu, don't run off like that!\" he shouts.\n"
"\"That will be Mr. Ashevak,\" Dr. Kensler says, scratching off another name from her list. Moments later, you watch as a large gray-furred dog bounds toward you, its tongue hanging out of its mouth in excitement. You lean over and pet the dog, running your hand along her thick, long fur. The man finally catches up to the dog, huffing with effort. 'Anyu… Come on, I thought I… trained you better than this,\" he says, catching his breath.\n"
"\"<minicaps>Eliyah Ashevak</minicaps> is our dog handler,\" Dr. Kensler interjects, \"He is in charge of taking care of the 44 sledge dogs we are bringing along with us, not to mention their feeding and training.\"\n"
"\"Anyu here makes 45,\" he corrects her before turning to shake your hand. \"Also, we'll be holed up in this ship for a while, so let's drop the formalities. Just 'Eliyah' is fine.\"\n"
"As the man and his enormous dog board the ship, you ask Dr. Kensler if she received the letter you sent regarding Professor Dyer's concerns. \"I am well aware of his report,' Dr. Kensler replies, \"but as I have told him time and time again, I have no intention of ceasing or postponing this expedition—\" Just then, footsteps approach behind you, interrupting your conversation. \"—speak of the devil,\" Dr. Kensler mutters, looking up from her clipboard. You turn to find none other than <minicaps>Professor William Dyer</minicaps> and his student <minicaps>Danforth</minicaps>, each toting several bags of luggage. \"I'm glad you finally decided to join us, William.\"\n"
"\"Amy,\" he acknowledges. \"I am not here because I believe in your mission statement. I am here to make sure you and your companions do not get themselves killed. You have no idea what you are walking into.\"\n"
"\"Then you will have ample enough opportunity to educate us along the way.\" She turns to address young Danforth, who is staring up at the tanker ship with a pained expression. \"Danforth, I hope you understand that you are under no obligation to come along on this expedition. After everything you went through…\" she trails off, her eyebrows raised in worry atypical of her usual cold demeanor.\n"
"\"I appreciate your concern, Dr. Kensler, but I am looking forward to the opportunity to return to Antarctica. I want… need… to be there again.\"\n"
"She follows his gaze to the Theodosia, which bobs steadily up and down on the choppy Atlantic waters. \"Very well. We are still working to get all of our equipment aboard. Mr. Ellsworth can help you find your rooms.\" You nod and begin boarding, along with the remaining crew and the rest of the expedition team—mostly students of the university, along with several unaffiliated explorers and several researchers in a variety of fields. Once more you spy the scant sliver of sunlight above before it is smothered by gray clouds."

"“噢，那不是當然的嗎？”站在她身邊的男子輕笑著回答。他伸出手與你握了一下，自我介紹道：“<minicaps>羅爾德·埃爾斯沃思</minicaps>為您效勞。”\n"
"肯斯勒博士通過介紹向你解釋：“埃爾斯沃思先生有參與數十場探險的經驗，在挑選本次探險成員時得到了強烈推薦。我相信在未來幾周，他的專業知識會顯得舉足輕重。”\n"
"埃爾斯沃思翻了個白眼。“他的專業知識，沒錯……而且他還能當苦力！”他邊笑著說，邊把你的行李搬起走上跳板。\n"
"“快點，埃爾斯沃思！”船內的另一個聲音喊道。一個長著濃密棕色鬍鬚、看起來很粗魯的男子出現了，示意埃爾斯沃思抓緊時間。“在啟程之前，我們還有很多工作要做呢！”\n"
"“我這有點忙，曲奇。”埃爾斯沃思大聲回答。然後他轉向你，指了指背後：“別介意他。曲奇只是有點過度熱情，不過是個好人。\n"
"“我是叫‘弗雷德里克斯’。”那個粗暴男子吼了回去。“<minicaps>詹姆斯·弗雷德里克斯</minicaps>。我發誓，有時候我覺得我是這裡唯一一個為這該死的旅行作好準備的人。”他生氣地低聲說，“難道沒人提過，用死在海上的人給船當名字不吉利嗎？”\n"
"另一個聲音從甲板上傳來：“曲奇，麻煩你把聲音壓低，這兒還有人想要幹活呢。”男子哼了一聲，翻著白眼鑽回船裡。抬頭望去，只見一個年輕女子斜倚在甲板的欄杆上，棕色長髮紮成一個濃密的馬尾，繞著脖子垂下。“嘿！你來了。”她大聲對你說，“對於你能前來，肯斯勒博士非常激動。期待與你合作。”\n"
"肯斯勒博士頭也不抬地低聲念叨：“<minicaps>高田弘子</minicaps>女士是我們的飛機技師。和上次探險一樣，我們會在現場組裝飛機。不用擔心——她可能是這個領域裡最年輕的，但是她明白自己在做什麼。\n"
"更多成員陸續到達。第一位是一名30多歲的男子，留著一小撮金色鬍鬚，有著明亮的綠色眼睛。“<minicaps>艾弗里·克萊普爾</minicaps>先生。”肯斯勒博士把你介紹給那名男子，你們握了握手。“克萊普爾先生是埃爾斯沃思先生的……熟人。他將擔任我們的南極嚮導。\n"
"“只要老天爺願意行個方便。”克萊普爾開玩笑道，“說實話，我們哪怕能從冰架上下來，就已經很幸運了。”\n"
"“我堅信在有了你的技術，我們至少能走得和戴爾和萊克他們一樣遠。”\n"
"“這正是我擔心的。”克萊普爾嘟囔著，快步地走過肯斯勒，上了跳板。他往上走，經過了埃爾斯沃思，然後兩人四目相對，仿佛被定住了一般。你發誓，當他們一句話都不說僵持著時，溫度下降了好幾度。\n"
"“他們的關係一直是……比較好的。”肯斯勒博士小聲說，“但最近卻出現了一些問題。他們最好學會容忍彼此的差異。畢竟，他們會在很長一段時間裡避不開對方了。”你看到克萊普爾的目光在埃爾斯沃思身上徘徊了片刻，然後他憤怒地轉身進入船艙。\n"
"接下來抵達的是一位有著淺棕色皮膚和疲倦眼睛的女子，除了她的行李，還有一個掛著白色十字的巨大亮紅的醫療箱擺在一起。她伸出手與肯斯勒博士握了握，而你留意到她的手在緊張地顫抖。“感謝你參加我們的這次航行， 瑪拉。”\n"
"“噢，艾米。總得有人負責你的生命安全。”她回答道。肯斯勒博士抬眼將那名女子從頭到腳打量一遍，有那麼一刻出現了尷尬的沉默，她的臉頰微微發紅。“嗯。那就這樣。”她說了句，然後繼續往船上走。\n"
"等她走遠了，肯斯勒博士清了清喉嚨。“<minicaps>瑪拉·辛哈醫生</minicaps>，是我們的醫師。”她解釋道，“說服她加入我們花了不少時間，所以盡量不要在一些無關緊要的問題上濫用她的專業技能。凍傷會是很嚴重的問題，還有壞疽和體溫過低也是。請盡量不要惹她生氣。”你不確定肯斯勒博士是否在開玩笑。\n"
"男子的聲音伴隨著一陣犬吠打破了這突然的寂靜。“安雨！該死的，安雨，別這樣亂跑!”他大吼。\n"
"“那是阿什瓦克先生。”肯斯勒博士說道，從她的名單上劃去另一個名字。過了一會，你看到一隻灰毛大狗向你撲來，興奮地伸出舌頭。你俯下身撫摸它，用手滑過它又厚又長的毛髮。後面的男子終於追了上來，上氣不接下氣。“安雨……拜託，我以為我……已經把你訓練好了。”他邊喘邊說。\n"
"“<minicaps>伊里亞·阿什瓦克</minicaps>是我們的馴犬師。”肯斯勒博士打斷了他，“他負責照顧我們帶來的44隻雪橇犬，當然還有餵養和訓練它們。”\n"
"“算上安雨是45隻。”他糾正了她，然後轉身與你握手。“還有，我們會在這艘船上共處一段時間，所以我們還是不要那麼拘謹了。叫我‘伊里亞’就好。”\n"
"當這名男子和他的大狗登上船時，你詢問肯斯勒博士是否收到了你寄出的信，是關於戴爾教授擔憂的事情的。“我很清楚他的報告。”肯斯勒博士回答道，“但正如我一再告訴他的，我並不打算停止或推遲這次探險——”就在這時，腳步聲從你身後傳來，打斷了你們的談話。\n"
"“——說曹操，曹操到。”肯斯勒博士喃喃自語著，將視線從寫字板上移開，抬起頭來。來的不是別人，正是<minicaps>威廉·戴爾教授</minicaps>和他的學生<minicaps>丹佛斯</minicaps>，他倆都提著幾包行李。“我很高興你最終決定加入我們，威廉。”\n"
