"\"There—see it?\" one of the team members hands you their binoculars and points into the distance. You've ventured just outside camp to find a defensible position where you hope can see the creatures approaching… but what you find instead is even worse. Not only are they encroaching on the campsite as you expected, but more are emerging from the ice by the minute.\n"
"You watch the ice shelf split open, and a geyser of multicolored miasma seeps from the cracks. Your companion clutches your arm and points you in another direction, where you see another geyser spill forth. Then, another. \"There has to be an end to them, right?\"\n"
"You lower the binoculars and tell the rest of the team to prepare for a fight. You don't know if you can hold off these strange creatures or not, but there's only one way to find out."

"你看到冰架裂開了，彩色的瘴氣噴泉從裂縫中滲出。你的同伴抓住你的手臂，指引你看向另一個方向，在那裡有另一道噴泉湧出。然後，又一道。“它們數量總得有個盡頭吧？”\n"
"你放下望遠鏡，告訴其他隊員準備戰鬥。你不確定你們能否抵擋住這些奇怪的生物，不過確認的方法也只有一個。"
