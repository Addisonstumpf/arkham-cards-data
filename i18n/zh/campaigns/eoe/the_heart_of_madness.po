msgid "Scenario IV: The Heart of Madness"
msgstr "冒險IV：瘋狂之心"

msgid "The next day, you plumb deeper into the caverns and pits beneath the icy crust of Antarctica. You pass under great archways of obsidian and primordial slate, through ornately-carven corridors and enormous, many-pillared halls, down into unknowable and unfathomable depths."
msgstr "第二天，你深入到南極冰層下的洞穴和坑中。你穿過黑曜石和原始石板砌成的巨大拱門，穿過裝飾華麗的走廊和有許多柱子的巨大大廳，進入未知的、深不可測的深淵。"

msgid "The team's leader pulls the group together for one last round of encouragement as you leave the relative safety of the surface behind. \"All right, everyone. I know these conditions are… not ideal,\" Dr. Kensler begins. \"But we are close. So very, very close. To getting answers. To making all of this effort, all of this madness worth something. Just a little further, and we will learn the truth.\" She sighs. \"This has been rough. On all of us. But please, bear with me a little while longer. I promise you, it will be worth it.\" Despite the otherwise grim mood, there is a murmuring of agreement among the survivors. You're not about to back down now."
msgstr "當你們離開相對安全的地表時，隊長把隊員們聚集在一起，給你們最後一輪鼓勵。“好了，各位。我知道現在的情況並不理想。”肯斯勒博士開始說道，“但我們很接近了。非常、非常近。很快就能找到答案。讓所有的努力，所有的瘋狂都有意義。再往前走一點，我們就能知道真相了。”她嘆了口氣。“這很艱難。對我們所有人來說都是。但是，請再忍耐一會兒。我向你們保證，這是值得的。”儘管形勢嚴峻，但倖存者之間還是達成了共識。現在不是你們打退堂鼓的時候。"

msgid "Step by step, you and the survivors trek further down the incline. The mood of your party is grim and hopeless. You feel as though there is no coming back from this place. You will likely meet your end here. The weight of this burdensome thought makes each of your steps heavy."
msgstr "你和其他倖存者一步一步地向下跋涉。你們團隊的氣氛嚴峻而絕望。你覺得好像再也回不去了。你的生命可能會在這裡終結。這份沉重的心情讓你舉步維艱。"

msgid "<i>If the investigators scouted the forked passage:</i>"
msgstr "如果<i>調查員偵察了分岔通道</i>："

msgid "Eventually, you come to a familiar fork in the cavern, the same passage you and Ellsworth scouted the previous night. You explain to the others that you felt air circulating through the leftmost passage the previous night, and that it is therefore unlikely to be a dead end. The others give a nod of agreement, and together you venture into what you believe is the correct passage."
msgstr "最終，你來到了洞穴中熟悉的岔路口，就是你和埃爾斯沃思前一晚偵察過的那條路。你向其他人解釋說，前一天晚上你感覺到最左邊的通道裡有空氣迴圈，因此不太可能是死路。其他人點頭同意，然後你們一起深入你所認為的正確道路。"

msgid "After setup, before the next game begins, the lead investigator may look at the revealed side of any two Ancient Facility locations in play."
msgstr "冒險設置後，在接下來的遊戲開始前，調查員隊長可以查看場上任意兩個古代設施地點的已揭示面。"

msgid "Eventually, you come to a fork in the cavern. To your left, the tunnel forks into a smaller, icy path with a steeper and more dangerous incline. To your right, the ramp simply continues onward without much change. With no other information to go off, you choose the larger of the two paths. It continues to fork along the way, taking you down a circuitous, lengthy route. You end up deeper within the caverns, though you're no longer sure how to get back…"
msgstr "最後，你來到了洞穴中的一個岔口。在你的左邊，隧道分叉成一個更小的、結冰的道路和一個更陡峭更危險的斜坡。在你的右邊，斜坡簡單地向前延伸，沒有太大的變化。在沒有其他資訊的情況下，你選擇兩條路中較大的那條。它繼續分叉，帶你進入一個曲折而漫長的路線。你最終進入了洞穴的深處，儘管你已不知該如何返回……"

msgid "Hours pass. Eventually, the passage seems to open into a larger corridor of worked stone, with one final archway marking the end of the titanic ramp you have been descending. Five unfamiliar glyphs adorn the archway, their meaning incomprehensible. The path on the other side seems more like a vast underground subway tunnel than a natural cavern formation - all smooth, angular stone punctuated by alien markings and covered faintly in putrid, multicolored ichor."
msgstr "幾個小時過去了。最後，這條通道似乎通向一個更大的石砌走廊，最後一個拱門標示著你正在下行的巨大坡道的盡頭。拱門上裝飾著五種陌生符號，它們的含義令人費解。另一邊的路看起來更像一個巨大的地鐵隧道，而不是一個天然的洞穴結構——所有光滑、稜角分明的石頭上都點綴著異星標記，上面微微覆蓋著腐敗的、五彩繽紛的膿液。"

msgid "\"The creatures-they made this place,\" Danforth reasons as you pass beneath the final archway. \"It is just as I suspected the last time I was here. This is no natural part of Antarctica. It is all connected. This is the true heart of their civilization.\" You ask Danforth what he means—what did you explore yesterday, if not their city? \"It was but the tip of the iceberg, if you will pardon the expression,\" he states. \"Like the highest story of a skyscraper. But the ice and snow buried the rest. We could not tell.\" You ask how far down he believes the city descends. \"From what we saw of their history?\" He meets your gaze, sweat beading down his forehead. With all seriousness, he replies, \"to the very bottom of the ocean.\""
msgstr "“這些生物——它們創造了這個地方。”當你從最後的拱門下經過時，丹佛斯推斷道，“正如我上次來這兒時所懷疑的那樣。這不是南極的自然部分。都聯繫起來了。這才是他們文明的真正核心。”你問丹佛斯他的意思是什麼——如果昨天那些不是它們的城市，那你們探索了什麼？“請原諒我這麼說，但這只是冰山一角。”他說，“就像摩天大樓的最高層。但是冰雪掩埋了剩下的部分。我們無法確認。”你問他認為這座城市會向下延伸多遠。“就我們所看到的有關它們的歷史來說？”他與你四目相望，汗珠順著前額流下。他一本正經地回答說：“通到海底吧。”"

msgid "As you cross under the final archway, you begin to question the truth of this place. You thought it to be a natural cavern at first, but now it is clear the Elder Things—or some other primeval, alien force—had a hand in its design . Or are you going about this all wrong? Perhaps they are not the ones cast from afar, intruders upon your home. Perhaps Antarctica—indeed, the Earth—was never meant for you, or any of your kind. The truth of humanity's insignificance rattles you to your core."
msgstr "當你穿過最後的拱門時，你開始質疑這個地方的真實性。起初你以為這是一個天然的洞穴，但現在清楚了，古老者——或其他某種原始的異星力量——參與了它的設計。還是說你們理解的這一切都是錯的？也許它們不是遠方來客，不是你們家園的入侵者。也許南極——甚至是地球——從來就不是為你們，或者你們的同類準備的。人類渺小的真相使你震驚萬分。"

msgid "Each investigator suffers 1 mental trauma."
msgstr "每位調查員受到1點精神創傷。"

msgid "If Miasmic Crystal is listed under \"Supplies Recovered\""
msgstr "如果“已回收的補給品”下有記錄瘴氣水晶："

msgid "Your backpack begins to glow once you enter this region of worked, carven stone. In a panic, you toss the pack off your shoulder and back away from it. Once a minute has passed without any change, you approach and carefully open it to reveal the strange otherworldly crystal you discovered shortly after the plane crash. It seems to be responding to this place, a bright glow and a droning hum emanating from within. It doesn't seem to be dangerous, so you tie the crystal around your waist and use its light to guide you onward."
msgstr "當你走進這個遍佈精雕細琢過的石頭的區域時，你的背包開始發光。在恐慌中，你把背包從肩上扔掉，並遠離它。一分鐘過去了，沒有任何變化，你走近並小心地打開它，看到了你在飛機墜毀後不久發現的，奇怪又超凡脫俗的水晶。它似乎是在回應這個地方，明亮的光芒和低沉單調的嗡嗡聲從內部散發出來。它看起來並不危險，所以你把水晶繫在你的腰上，用它的光引導你前進。"

msgid "The darkness beyond is like the abyss at the bottom of the ocean. Your torches and lanterns reach only a few feet ahead before their light is swallowed by black. Coupled with the intense pressure and biting cold, you feel as though the weight of the entire world looms over you. It is a journey of unparalleled dread."
msgstr "遠處的黑暗就像海底深淵。你的火把和提燈只能籠罩面前幾英尺的地方，再遠處它們的光就被黑暗吞沒了。再加上巨大的壓力和刺骨的寒冷，你覺得整個世界的重量都在逼近你。這是一次前所未有的恐懼之旅。"

msgid ""
"Finally, at the end of this vast chamber, you come to a nexus within the dormant structure: a scaled gateway of immense size, emblazoned with the same five glyphs, along with a series of interlocking mechanisms. Channels and grooves mark a path from the door's surface back to each of the five glyphs.\n"
"Beyond the gate, you hear a familiar churning, the bubbling and frothing of miasma, and the seething of hateful mist. \"It is beyond this door,\" one of your party says, and you cannot help but agree. You can feel its presence or rather, you have felt its presence all along, ever since you set foot on Antarctica, only now its call is impossible to ignore. It whispers faintly to you. Along the surface of your mind, visions play out. Your wildest dreams and most joyful moments. Your darkest desires and hardest struggles. It is a mirage. The mirage. Sealed behind this door, likely for eons upon end, watched over, or perhaps even harnessed, by those who came before you. But it is escaping, bit by bit. The creatures you have encountered and fought are evidence enough of that. The Elder Things know it is breaking free, too. They built this place, and now it is abandoned…"

"最後，在這個巨大房間的盡頭，你來到了休眠建築中的一個連接點：一個巨大的密封大門，上面裝飾著同樣的五個符號，還有一系列聯動機制。通道和凹槽標示出從門的表層連通到每一個符號的路徑。\n"
"在大門之外，你可以聽到熟悉的翻騰聲，瘴氣冒泡聲，以及可怕煙霧的沸騰聲。“就在這扇門後面。”團隊內的一人說，你不禁表示同意。你能感覺到它的存在——或者更確切地說，從你踏上南極開始，你就一直感覺到它的存在，只是現在你已無法忽視它的召喚。它輕聲對你低語著。在你內心汪洋的海面處，幻覺開始浮現。你最狂野的夢境，你最快樂的時刻。你最黑暗的欲望，你最艱難的掙扎。它是幻景。幻景是它。封印於這扇門後，數不清的歲月，被你之前的存在守望著，甚至可能被套上過韁繩。但它正在漸漸地，逃離此處。你遇到並戰鬥過的生物就足以證明這一點。古老者也知道它正在掙脫。他們建了這個地方，現在卻廢棄了……"
