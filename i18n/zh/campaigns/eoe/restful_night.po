"Safe at last, you and the remaining members of the expedition take stock of your situation. You have lost several members of the team, but your members remain strong. Part of you knows that staying any longer would prove foolish or deadly. But a great many questions crowd your thoughts, demanding answers despite your worries. What were those uncanny, Phantasmal creatures? What happened here after Dyer’s expedition left the icy wastes behind?\n"
"You and the others discuss the situation at length and consider various plans. Some believe in the total abandonment of the expedition. But to return empty-handed now would prove disastrous for the university, frustrate the scientific community, and possibly cost the remaining crew their careers. After all, very few believed Dyer’s outlandish claims --who would believe this?\n"
"In the end, you decide to press onward. Another flight is out of the question, of course. That thing in the sky must still be out there. It was a miracle you survived one aeroplane crash, let alone two. No, there’s only one way to reach the site described in Dyer’s report now: you must travel on foot.\n"
"The decision made, you retire to get what meager rest you can before the grueling trek ahead."

"你們最終安全了，開始評估當前的處境。你們失去了幾名隊員，但你們的人數依然夠多。你心裡明白，再待下去是非常愚蠢且致命的。但心中除了擔憂，還有大量疑問未能解答。那些不可思議的、幽靈般的生物到底是什麼？在戴爾他們那次探險結束後，這冰封荒原發生了什麼？\n"
"你和其他人詳細討論情況並考慮各種計畫。有些人認為應該徹底放棄探險。但是現在空手而歸對大學來說將是災難性的，會讓科學界失望，還可能會讓剩下的成員丟了飯碗。畢竟，幾乎沒人相信戴爾古怪的說法——誰會信？\n"
"最後，你們還是決定繼續前進。當然，再飛一次就不用想了。天上的那個東西肯定還在。你能在一次空難中倖存已經是個奇跡了，不要奢望第二次。沒別的辦法了，要到達戴爾報告中描述的地點，現在只有一種方式：步行。\n"
"作出決定後，你渾身癱軟下來，在風雪載途前抓緊時間休息。"

msgid "You only have enough time to check on a few team members (regardless of whether they are alive or crossed out). One at a time, choose and read three of the sections below (four instead if <i>the team fled to the mountains</i>). If the game effect of the chosen section cannot be performed, it does not count toward this total and you may choose a new section instead."
msgstr "你只有一點時間去查看幾名隊員(無論他們是活著還是被劃掉)。每次選擇以下一個部分閱讀，一共三次(如果<i>隊伍逃進山脈中</i>，改為四次)。如果所選擇的部分的遊戲效果不能執行，則這次選擇不計數，你可以改為再選擇一個新的部分。"

msgid "The professor jumps as you approach, startled by your sudden presence. “Oh! My apologies. I thought—I thought perhaps you were…” he trails off, but he doesn’t need to finish his sentence. You know exactly how he feels. “I am a man of science, as you know. And as a man of science, I find myself struggling to…to come to terms with what we have seen thus far.” You nod and ask Dyer to explain his current working theory. “Well,” he begins, “these spectral creatures, they seem to possess some kind of ethereal physiology, very unlike the Elder Things that Lake and his team discovered and dissected the last time I was here. Those creatures might have been of alien origin, but they were…like us, in more ways than one. Flesh and organs, you see. But these…” he ponders in silence for some time. “And yet, I cannot help but wonder what the connection between the two might be?”"
msgstr "當你走近時，教授被你的突然出現嚇了一跳。“噢！抱歉。我以為——我還以為你已經……”他話音漸衰，但是他已無需再說下去了。你完全明白他的感受。“你知道，我是一名從事科學研究的人。而作為一名從事科學的人，我發現我自己很難……很難接受我們迄今為止看到的東西。”你點頭並請求戴爾解釋他目前得出的理論。“好吧。”他開始說，“這些幽靈生物，它們似乎擁有某種飄渺的生理機能，與我上次在這裡時萊克團隊發現並解剖的古老者完全不同。那些生物可能源自外星，但它們又……很像我們，就許多方面來說。肉體和器官，你也看到了。但是這些……”他沉默地思考了一會兒。“而且，我不禁想知道這兩者之間有什麼聯繫呢？”"

msgid "Danforth mutters to himself over and over as you enter his tent: “‘…There seemed now to be no longer any room for hope…and I could perceive…in the countenances of my companions…that they had made up their minds to perish…’” The cadence of his voice suggests he is reciting something by memory rather than speaking his thoughts aloud. It’s only after you loudly clear your throat that he seems to notice your presence. His eyes are wide and unblinking. “Now you understand,” he says under his breath. “You have seen what I have seen.” You nod. There can be no doubt any longer. Whatever Danforth saw when he and the professor escaped their ill-fated journey is the same entity that smote your aircraft to the ground. “It knows we are here,” he says gloomily. “It sees us.”"
msgstr "你進入丹佛斯的帳篷時，他正在自言自語：現在已經沒有希望了……而且在我那些同伴的臉上……我可以感覺到……他們已經下定決心要滅亡……”他聲音的節奏表明，他是在背誦什麼東西，而不是在說出自己的想法。你大聲清了清嗓子，他才注意到你的存在。他的眼睛睜得大大的，一眨也不眨。“現在你明白了。”他低聲說，“你看到了我所看到的。”你點頭。這毋庸置疑。丹佛斯在他和教授逃離厄運之旅時看到的，就是把你們的飛機撞到地面的那個東西。“它知道我們在這裡。”他沮喪地說，“它看見我們了。”"

msgid "Listening to Danforth gives you further insight into the madness of this place. Any one investigator may begin <b>Scenario II: To the Forbidden Peaks</b> with two additional cards drawn in their opening hand."

msgid "If Dr. Amy Kensler is alive:"
msgstr "如果艾米·肯斯勒博士活著："

msgid "The leader of the expedition gives you little heed as you enter her tent. Her eyes are instead glued to the microscope in front of her. She appears to be studying a glob of inky, multicolored ichor in a small petri dish. She must have recovered some of that gunk earlier. You ask if she thinks it’s safe to be studying it so closely. “Of course not,” she responds in dry monotone. “But sometimes, scientific progress requires an element of…jeopardy.” It’s true, in a way—you’re only here at all because the team decided to put themselves at risk in order to confirm the truth behind Dyer’s report. You ask Dr. Kensler what she has discovered. “Frustratingly little. Physiologically speaking, this substance is unlike anything I’ve ever seen. I’m…not even completely sure it is a liquid. It seems to possess qualities of all three states of matter.” She finally sets the microscope aside, covers the petri dish, and meets your gaze. “It would be fascinating, were it not trying to kill us.”"
msgstr "你走進帳篷時，探險隊的領袖並沒有注意到你。相反，她的眼睛緊緊盯著面前的顯微鏡。她似乎在研究一個小小培養皿中的一團五彩斑斕的墨狀膿液。她之前肯定自己採集了一些這種黏性物質。你問在如此近距離研究是否安全。“當然不安全了。”她乾巴巴地回道。“但有時候，進步需要一種……名為危險的元素。”某種程度上來說，這確實沒錯——你在這裡的原因都只是因為整個團隊為了確認戴爾的報告背後的真相，而決定置身於危險之中。你詢問肯斯勒博士的發現。“令人沮喪，幾乎沒有發現。從生理學上講，這種物質和我見過的任何物質都不一樣。我……甚至不太確定它是不是液體。它似乎擁有所有三種物質狀態的特性。”最後，她把顯微鏡放在一邊，蓋上培養皿，與你的目光相對。“如果不是它想殺我們，這會非常吸引人。”"

msgid "Dr. Kensler's research allows you to view the situation with greater clarity. In your Campaign Log, record <i>Dr. Kensler is sharing her research with you.</i>"
msgstr "肯斯勒博士的研究使你更清楚地觀察情況。在劇本日誌中，記錄<i>肯斯勒博士與你分享她的研究</i>。"

msgid "Dr. Kensler is sharing her research with you."
msgstr "肯斯勒博士與你分享她的研究。"

msgid "Dr. Sinha gives you a hard glare as you approach. “If you tell me that you are ‘too cold to sleep,’ so help me…” she begins, but sighs as you shake your head. “Sorry. I know, I know. Show me your wounds, then. Let me do my job.” She pulls out her medical kit and motions for you to sit on the bedroll nearby. “No signs of frostbite, hypothermia, or gangrene, that is good…” In silence, she studies the bruises and surface injuries you sustained from the crash. Finally, she clicks her tongue and shakes her head. “Uncanny,” she murmurs under her breath. You give her an inquiring stare. “Two aeroplanes,” she explains, “over a dozen of us spread between the two, and yet we sustained more injuries from the journey across the ice shelf than we did in the crash. Except for…” she trails off into harsh silence. As she dresses your wounds, you think about the meaning behind her words, the truth that she doesn’t want to say out loud. Was the entity that forced your plane to the ground really trying to kill you? Or was it simply guiding you? And if so, to what?"
msgstr "在你靠近時，辛哈醫生狠狠瞪了你一眼。“如果你告訴我你是因為‘太冷了睡不著’……”她開口，但看到你搖頭時嘆了口氣，“抱歉。我明白的。那麼給我看看你的傷口吧。讓我做好我的工作。”她拿出她的醫療箱，示意你坐在旁邊的鋪蓋卷上。“沒有凍傷、體溫過低或壞疽的跡象，這很好……”她默默地研究著你在墜機中受的瘀傷和表面傷。最後，她咂咂舌頭，搖了搖頭。“太詭異了。” 她低聲說。你用詢問的眼神看著她。“兩架飛機。”她解釋道，“我們十幾個人分散在兩架飛機中，但我們在穿越冰架的旅途中受的傷比墜機時還要多。除了……”她的聲音慢慢變小，陷入嚴峻的沉默。她給你包紮傷口的時候，你思考著她的話背後的含義，她不想說出來的真相。迫使你們的飛機掉到地面的那個存在真的想殺了你們嗎？或者它只是在引導你們？如果是這樣的話，要把你們引導去哪兒呢?"

msgid "Cookie stares into the campfire as you approach, clearly in a world of his own. His distant eyes reflect the dim, flickering firelight. Who knows what he really sees within? The moment you begin to speak, he startles out of his reverie. “Ah. S’only you,” he mutters, his voice gravelly. “Siddown. Fire’s not just for me.” You do, taking off your gloves and warming up your hands for a moment before asking Cookie what he thinks of the plan. “What do I think?” He almost laughs. “I think yer deluded, the lot of yeh. But what do I know.” You suspect aloud that he knows a lot more than the others think. “That so?” he asks in grim monotone. “’Bout war, maybe,” he growls. “But maybe that’s what this is after all. Right then. You wanna know what I know? Fine.” You listen intently as Cookie tells you his harrowing tales of the Great War, tales that would surely give you nightmares were you not already in one."
msgstr "你走近時，曲奇正盯著篝火，顯然沉浸在自己的世界裡。他那迷茫的眼睛反射出朦朧閃爍的火光。誰會知道他真正看到了什麼？你剛開口，他就從沉思中驚醒了過來。“啊，是你啊。”他咕噥著，聲音沙啞。“坐，一起烤火。”你照做了，脫下手套，暖了暖雙手，然後開口詢問曲奇對這個計畫的看法。“我怎麼想的？”他忍不住要笑了。“我覺得你們這幫人都鬼迷心竅了。但我又懂什麼。”你說你懷疑他其實知道的比別人以為的要多。“這樣嗎？”他低沉地回問。“打仗方面的話，或許吧。”他低聲咆哮，“但也許這就是事情的真相。那麼，你想知道我知道些啥？行。”你全神貫注地聽著曲奇講述他關於第一次世界大戰的悲慘故事，這些故事肯定會讓你做噩夢，如果你還不算已經在噩夢中的話。"

msgid "Claypool is examining a map of the Ross Ice Shelf as you approach, tracing his fingers over topographical lines. “We were supposed to have better weather conditions,” he explains as you hunch over next to him. “I don’t know how or why, but something is messing with the weather patterns here. We’re getting hit with storms too sudden even for Antarctica, and the temperature variance is closer to what we would find in winter.” You ask Claypool if there’s anything that can be done to prevent further hardship. “The inclination might be to hunker down,” he replies, “and surely there are some among us who are too exhausted to go on. There are others who feel the opposite: that we should leave immediately and find safety elsewhere. I believe the best course of action is somewhere in between.” He taps the map in front of him again, beckoning you closer. “These storms are hitting fast and hard. We have to find our opening and move out the moment this one lets up,” he explains. You nod in approval."
msgstr "你走近時，克萊普爾正在研究羅斯島冰架的地圖，手指在地形線上描畫著。你湊到他身邊彎下腰看，他解釋道：“我們本來應該有更好的天氣條件的。”“我不知道是怎麼回事，也不知道是為什麼，但有什麼東西擾亂了這裡的天氣模式。即便這裡是南極，但襲擊我們的風暴也實在太突然了，而且溫度的變化也更接近我們在冬天觀測的情況。”你詢問克萊普爾能不能做點什麼來避免更多的苦難。“按目前情況我們應該原地休整一下。”他回答道，“而且我確信我們中一些人已經筋疲力盡，沒法前進了。其他人的想法恰恰相反：我們應該立即離開，到別處尋找安全的地方。我認為最好的做法是介於兩者之間。”他再次輕輕敲了下放在面前的地圖，示意你靠近。“這些風暴襲擊得又快又猛。我們得找機會，在條件允許的時候衝出去。”他解釋道。你點頭表示贊同。"

msgstr "此外，如果羅爾德·埃爾斯沃思還活著："

msgid ""
"Curious, you pry a bit, asking Claypool what the deal is between him and Ellsworth. “Huh? Oh, Roald? We—that—” he stammers, avoiding your gaze. “He is just so damn stubborn. And hard to read.” You raise an eyebrow. “Okay, it is more than that. He is a loner. By his very nature. Getting close to somebody like that…” he sighs, trying to muster up the words. “…is difficult. For both parties.”\n"
"But worth it, you observe aloud.\n"
"“Yes, I suppose it can be,” he replies with a smile. “Sometimes.”"
msgstr ""
"你很好奇，就試著向克萊普爾打聽他和埃爾斯沃思之間是怎麼回事。“哈？噢，羅爾德？我們——嗯——”他結結巴巴地說著，躲避著你的目光。“他就是太固執了。而且也很難讀懂他。”你挑了挑眉毛。“好吧，不止如此。他總是獨來獨往。他天性如此。要接近這樣一個人……”他嘆了口氣，努力組織語言，“……是很困難的。對雙方而言都是如此。”\n"
"但這值得，你說出了你的想法。\n"
"“是的，我想確實如此。”他微笑著回答。“有時是的。”"

msgid "Ellsworth throws you a pocket telescope as you meander through the camp, searching for a task. “You look free. Follow me,” he demands. You roll your eyes and follow begrudgingly as he leads you out into the snowy wilds. Over the howling winds, you ask loudly where he is taking you. “Higher,” Ellsworth responds simply. For nearly an hour, you follow him up a treacherous trail through rocky crags to an icy precipice overlooking the ice shelf. Black, jagged mountains loom in the distance, barely visible through the harsh snowfall. “There,” he says, pointing between two of the peaks. “What does that look like, to you?” You raise the telescope up to your eyes, careful not to press the cold glass against your skin lest it freeze there. Magnified by the device’s lens, you can just make out a narrow pass between the peaks. Perhaps this would be the optimal route to take tomorrow? You convey your thoughts to Ellsworth, and he nods along. “I agree. I’ll mark it on our map when we get back to camp.”"
msgstr "當你在營地中漫步，尋找能做的事時，埃爾斯沃思扔給你一個袖珍望遠鏡。“你看著沒事幹。跟我來。”他要求道，你翻了個白眼，不情不願地跟在他後面，而他帶著你走進了白雪皚皚的荒野。在呼嘯的狂風中，你大聲詢問他要把你帶到哪裡去。“高處。”埃爾斯沃思簡短地回答。在將近一個小時的時間裡，你跟著他沿著一條危險的小路穿過岩石峭壁來到一個可以俯瞰冰架的冰崖。鋸齒狀的黑色山脈隱約出現在遠處，在嚴酷的大雪中幾乎看不見。“那兒。”他說著，指著兩座山峰之間，“你覺得那像什麼？”你舉起望遠鏡，小心地不把冰冷的玻璃貼在你的皮膚上，以免凍結住。被設備放大後，你恰好能看到山峰之間狹窄的通道。也許這是明天的最佳路線？你把你的想法告訴埃爾斯沃思，他也點頭附和。“我同意。等我們回到營地，我會在地圖上做記號。”"

We will have to be smart about our supplies if we are to continue this folly.” She spits that last word out like a curse, leaving you to ponder her feelings about the expedition. “Well, come on, don’t just stand there. Help me with this,” she scolds. You nod and get to work."

The dog’s tail slaps back and forth rapidly as you approach. “Oh, hey there,” Eliyah says over his shoulder when he realizes Anyu’s spotted you. “Calm down, will you, Anyu?” he scolds playfully, reaching down to ruffle her ears. You ponder aloud if she realizes the danger you’re all in. “Oh, she knows,” Eliyah responds. “She is rather good at making all the troubles of the world fade away. It wouldn’t be the first time.” You wonder with a bit of curiosity what other adventures Eliyah and Anyu might have been on in the past. But before you can ask, a cold flask hits you square in the chest and tumbles into your hands. “Drink,” Eliyah offers. “It’ll warm you up.” He sits down and drinks from a flask of his own, motioning for you to join him. You do, gulping down a large swallow. It burns on its way down. Anyu lies between the two of you, nudging your hand pleadingly. No more words are spoken, but Eliyah is right. For just a moment, everything is okay."
