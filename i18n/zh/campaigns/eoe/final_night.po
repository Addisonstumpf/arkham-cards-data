msgid ""
"You would hesitate to call the darkened pit you find yourself in \"safe\" by any means, but you feel as though this is as good a place as any to rest. It was hard enough to tell the time with the sun always lingering in the Antarctic sky—now, deep underground with no sunlight to speak of, it is impossible. When one of your companions checks their pocketwatch and informs the team that fourteen hours have passed since you went underground, the response is one of utter disbelief. You do not remember traveling that long, but your body is weary enough to prove it.\n"
"In gloomy silence, you and the others set up camp once more. Your numbers have dwindled to only yourself and the few experts who remain from those originally introduced to you by Dr. Kensler. The rest of the students and researchers are either back at the barrier camp where you first disembarked from the Theodosia, or… no longer with you.\n"
"The cavern is easily large enough for what few of you remain, and the icy floor brittle enough to stake down your tents. Even so, it does not truly feel safe. You wonder if you will ever feel safe again."
msgstr ""
"你猶豫自己身處的黑暗之坑是否能稱為“安全”，但不管怎樣你覺得這是一個休息的好地方。太陽在南極上空徘徊永不落下的時候，分辨時間已經夠難了——而現在，深處地底，根本沒有陽光，要靠陽光分辨時間是更加不可能的了。當你的一個同伴看了看懷錶，告訴其他人自從進入地下已經過去了14個小時，其他人的反應是完全不敢相信。你不記得走了那麼長的路，但你的身體疲倦得足以證明這一點。\n"
"在陰鬱寂靜中，你和其他人又搭起了營地。隊伍人數已經減少到除了你只有肯斯勒博士一開始介紹給你的少數專家了。其他學生和研究員要麼回到了第一次從<b>菲奧多西亞號</b>登陸的屏障營地，要麼……已經不在了。\n"
"洞穴足夠大，足以容納你們剩下的這點人，而冰冷的地面也足夠硬，足以支撐你們的帳篷。即便如此，它也並不會真正讓人感到安全。你想知道你是否還有機會能再次感受到安全。"

msgid "You only have enough time to check on a few team members (regardless of whether they are alive or crossed out). One at a time, choose and read three of the sections below (four instead if <i>the team was guided to the hidden tunnel</i>). If the game effect of the chosen section cannot be performed, it does not count toward this total and you may choose a new section instead."
msgstr "你只有一點時間去查看幾名隊員(無論他們是活著還是被劃掉)。每次選擇以下一個部分閱讀，一共三次(如果<i>隊伍被引導到隱秘隧道</i>，改為四次)。如果所選擇的部分的遊戲效果不能執行，則這次選擇不計數，你可以改為再選擇一個新的部分。"

msgid "The professor, who was originally reluctant to join the expedition at all, seems to have completely changed his tune… although this new side of him worries you even more. \"I understand now why Danforth wanted to return,\" he explains. \"It is calling to us. Can you not feel it? Can you not hear it? It wants us to keep going.\" You ask him what 'it' he refers to, and he gestures vaguely around the both of you. \"It. I don't know. These phantasms don't act like independent creatures, do you not think? Perhaps they are controlled by a greater force. Or…\" he considers his next words carefully. \"Perhaps they are all one and the same. Extensions of one nameless madness. I wonder—what would Danforth and I have discovered had we not fled? Perhaps we could have avoided all this suffering…\""
msgstr "原先非常抗拒參加這次探險的教授似乎完全改變了他的態度……儘管他這新的一面更讓你擔心。“我現在明白丹佛斯為什麼想回來了。”他解釋道，“它在召喚我們。你感覺不到它嗎？你聽不到它的聲音嗎？它希望我們繼續前進。”你詢問他“它”指的是什麼，而他在你倆周圍比了個含糊的手勢。“它。我不知道。這些幻影不像獨立的生物，你不覺得嗎？也許他們被更強大的力量控制著。或者……”他仔細考慮著接下來要說的話，“也許它們都是同一個個體。是某種不可名狀的瘋狂的延伸。我很好奇——如果丹佛斯和我沒有逃走，我們會發現什麼呢？也許我們本可以免受這一切的……”"

msgid "You don't speak to Danforth that night. He is the one who speaks, but to what entity, you cannot tell. At first you believe him to be mumbling to himself as he often does, but soon you realize it is a dialogue you only partially hear. \"We are close,\" he declares quietly. \"I followed, just as you showed me. Just a little further, and I will see you again. We can be together again. We can be… whole.\" Finally, you decide you have heard enough. You clasp a hand on Danforth's shoulder, startling him. You swear you see just the slightest tinge of something misty leaking from his eyes as he turns around, but then he wipes them with his sleeve, and it is gone. \"Oh, it is just you,\" he comments. \"W-well then. We should get some rest, should we not? We have a long day ahead of us.\""
msgstr "那晚你沒有跟丹佛斯說話。他是唯一說話的人，但是在跟誰說，你卻不得而知。一開始，你認為他一如既往在自言自語，但很快你就意識到，你只是聽到了這段對話的一部分。“我們很近了。”他平靜地宣告著，“我完全跟隨著你的指引。只要再前進一點點，我就能再見到你了。我們就可以再次在一起了。我們就……完整了。”最後，你覺得自己聽的夠多了。你將一隻手搭在丹佛斯的肩膀上，他嚇了一跳。你發誓，當他轉過身來的時候，你恰好看到有一種模糊的霧狀物從他的眼睛裡漏出來，但隨後他用袖子擦了擦，就不見了。“噢，是你啊。”他說道，“那、那好吧。我們應該休息一下了，對吧？我們還有很多路要走。”"

msgid "Listening to Danforth gives you further insight into the madness of this place. Any one investigator may begin <b>Scenario IV: The Heart of Madness</b> with two additional cards drawn in their opening hand."
msgstr "聽丹佛斯的一番話使你更深入洞悉了此地的瘋狂。任意一位調查員可以在開始<b>冒險IV：瘋狂之心</b>的時候額外有兩張起始手牌。"

msgid "Dr. Kensler is in an absolute panic when you enter her tent. Her gaze rises to meet yours for just a moment before she goes back to rummaging through her materials. \"It is here somewhere, I know it…\" she mumbles. You've never seen Dr. Kensler in such disarray before. \"Ah! Here.\" The book she identifies is not one of her treatises on biology or a textbook filled with anatomical diagrams. It is an old, moldy tome unrelated to any of the sciences, written in French. \"I know I saw it in here…\" she mumbles, scouring the tome's pages for a specific passage. You sit nearby in silence, almost too frightened to ask anything. Dr. Kensler has changed completely from her usual cold, stoic demeanor. \"Here!\" She marks her page and snaps back to you. \"Can I trust you?\" You nod your head. Whatever Dr. Kensler has found, you get the feeling she is only showing you because you have shared in her discoveries up until this point. She opens the tome to a depiction of some unfamiliar, cosmic hierarchy-the kind of absurd dogmatic theory that any self-respecting scientist would scoff at. \"Henry Armitage was the only other person at the university who did not approve of this undertaking. He is the one who showed me this, after Dyer submitted his report.\" She points to the section of the diagram illustrating the Earth, and you note the pattern of intersecting lines at its edge. \"The south pole,\" she says. \"At the edge of the Earth, where the lines meet. The culmination of eldritch forces, he said. Superstitious nonsense, I presumed. But my research proves otherwise. These creatures—these phantom mirages, eidolons of broken minds, they did not arrive here. They were always here. From the very beginning. Do you understand?\" She grips her miasma sample tight. \"And we… we weren't the first to stumble across them.\""

"當你進入肯斯勒博士的帳篷時，她非常驚慌。她的目光與你的目光相對了一會兒，然後她又繼續翻找她的材料。“它就在這兒某個地方，我知道的……”她喃喃地說。你從沒見過肯斯勒博士如此混亂。“啊！這裡。”她找出的這本書不是她的生物學論文，也不是充滿解剖圖例的教科書。這是一本古老發霉的著作，與科學無關，是用法語寫的。“我知道我在這裡見過它……”她喃喃地說，仔細翻閱著這本書，尋找特定的一段。你靜靜地坐在旁邊，怕得什麼都不敢問。肯斯勒博士完全改變了她平時冷漠、平淡的態度。“就是這兒！”她在頁面上做了標記，然後啪地一聲合上書轉向你。“我能信任你嗎？”\n"
"你點頭。無論肯斯勒博士發現了什麼，你都覺得她會給你看只是因為到目前為止她一直在分享她的發現給你。她打開書本，翻到一段內容，描述的是某種陌生的宇宙層級體系——任何有自尊心的科學家都會嘲笑這是荒謬的教條理論。“亨利·阿米蒂奇是大學裡僅有的另一個不贊成這個項目的人。在戴爾提交了他的報告之後，是他給我看了這個。”她指著圖解中地球的部分，你注意到在地球邊緣相交的線構成的圖案。“南極。”她說，“在地球邊緣，線條相交之處。他說，這是邪惡意象的巔峰。我以前認為這不過是迷信的無稽之談。但我的研究證明並非如此。這些生物，這些虛幻的幻景，破碎心靈的幻靈，它們並沒有來到這裡。它們一直在這兒。自最初之時。明白了嗎？”她緊緊抓住瘴氣樣本。“而且我們……我們不是第一個發現它們的。”"

msgid "For the first time since the expedition set out, Dr. Sinha seeks you out personally, inquiring after your wounds. You show her your injuries, and she nods along, holding back her usual castigation. She tends your wounds in silence until she finally speaks. \"I have lost so many patients, I can no longer keep track,\" she reveals. \"Most of the time, there was nothing to be done. That is just the nature of things, I suppose. We are fragile creatures, after all. Bend us just a little bit, and we tend to break.\" She winds a bandage around your arm with practiced precision, but you spot the subtle shaking in her hands. \"I went into this profession because I could not stand seeing people hurt. It was a pretty foolish decision, looking back. After all, in this profession, all I do is see people hurt.\" You ask her if there is any satisfaction in seeing them healthy, once her work is done. \"Of course,\" she replies, after a long sigh. \"But this time…\" She averts her gaze from your eyes, her voice practically a whisper. \"I do not think I will get that satisfaction. Do you?\""
msgstr "自從探險隊出發以來，辛哈醫生第一次親自來找你，詢問你的傷勢。你給她看你的傷，她點點頭，忍住了平時的責備。她默默地照料你的傷口，直到她開口。“我失去了太多的病人，多到我再也記不下了。”她說，“大多數時候，我都無能為力。我想這就是事情的本質。畢竟，我們是脆弱的生物。輕輕一彎就折成兩段。”她熟練地用繃帶纏繞你的手臂，但你發現她的手在微微顫抖。“我入行是因為我無法忍受僅僅只能眼睜睜看著人們受到傷害。但現在回想起來，那是個相當愚蠢的決定。畢竟，在這個行業裡，我所做的就是看著別人受傷。”你問她，在她完成工作後，看到人們健康是否會有任何滿足感。“那當然。”她長嘆一聲後回答，“但這一次……”她把目光從你的眼睛上移開，她的聲音輕得像耳語。“我不認為我會得到那種滿足。你呢？”"

msgid "Cookie draws his Colt as vou approach. You can tell from his bloodshot eyes and shaking hand that he has not rested in some time. The moment he realizes it's only you, he apologizes and lowers the weapon. \"Thought you were one of—well y'know,\" he explains half-heartedly. You remark that you're lucky he has any trigger discipline left. \"Trigger discipline,\" he scoffs. A long pause hangs in the air. \"C'mon. Help me with the fire.\" In silence, you and the grizzled veteran set what remains of your firewood in the center of the camp and attempt to light it. In the cold, damp conditions, it takes almost half an hour of effort before the fire is lit. It eagerly consumes the kindling, casting dancing shadows along the icy walls of the cavern. Finally, Cookie breaks the silence. \"This,\" he utters decisively. \"I remember this.\" You don't bother to ask—you only have to meet his faraway gaze to know he is referring to the feeling of impending death permeating the camp. \"Piece of advice\" he offers, \"when the time comes, you can't hesitate. Don't matter how many of us are left. Don't matter what manner of doom yer staring down. You flinch, you die.\" You nod in understanding. You get the feeling Cookie's never flinched once in his life."
msgstr "你走近時，曲奇拔出了他的柯爾特手槍。你可以從他充血的眼睛和顫抖的手看出，他有一段時間沒有休息過了。當他意識到是你時，他道歉並放下了武器。“我還以為是——嗯，你懂的。”他敷衍地解釋著。你說他還能管的住扣扳機的手，自己真是走運。“呵，管的住手。”他語氣譏諷地回應。然後是一段時間的沉默。“好了。來幫我生下火。”在沉默中，你和頭髮花白的老兵把剩下的柴火放在營地中心，試圖點燃它。在寒冷潮濕的環境下，你們花了將近半小時的努力才生起了火。它急切地消耗著燃料，在洞穴冰冷的牆壁上投下跳動的影子。最終，曲奇打破了沉默。“這個。”他決然地說道。“我記得這個。”你不必費心去問——只要看看他那凝望遠處的目光，你就知道他指的是彌漫在營地裡，即將到來的死亡的感覺。“給你個忠告。他說，“到時候，你絕不能猶豫。”不管我們還剩下多少人。不管你面對的是怎樣的災厄。一旦退縮，你就會死。”你點頭表示理解。你感覺曲奇這輩子從沒退縮過一次。"

msgid "Claypool studies the icy walls as you approach, his brow furrowed with concern. \"It should be warmer here,\" he notes, \"but even without windchill, it is almost 10 degrees colder.\" Just then, something moves inside the ice—a shadow, perhaps, or something reflecting off its surface. You and Claypool instinctively back away as the fleeting darkness swirls and vanishes. No light behind you could have cast that shadow. \"There is… something wrong with this ice,\" Claypool whispers. \"This cold, it is unnatural. Dyer's report described these inner structures as warm and habitable, but this is…\" You share a knowing glance. \"We need to be prepared. For anything.\""
msgstr "當你走近時，克萊普爾研究著冰冷的牆壁，他的眉頭緊鎖著。“這裡明明應該更暖和些的。”他說，“但即使沒有寒風，這裡也要冷近10度。”就在這時，有什麼東西在冰裡移動——也許是影子，或者是冰面反射出來的什麼東西。黑影旋轉並轉瞬即逝，你和克萊普爾本能地後退。你身後的光投不出這樣的影子。“這冰……有問題。”克萊普爾低聲說。“這種寒冷，是反常的。戴爾的報告將這些內部建築描述為溫暖宜居，但這……”你們會意地對視一眼。“我們需要做好準備。做好能面對一切的準備。"

msgid "You already know what Ellsworth is thinking when he approaches you, a lantern in one of his hands and an icepick in the other. \"You up for a little trip?\" He hands the lantern to you, and together you break off from the camp. You make quiet, cautious conversation as you explore the icy depths, covering far more ground between the two of you than you could with the rest of your team and what is left of your supplies. \"You must think me some manner of mad or foolish,\" he guesses after an hour of fast-paced travel. \"Always going off alone, getting into danger like this. Into places we should not end up.\" You shrug and point out the fact that you, too, are here with him. \"Right. So I doubt your opinion of me is unbiased,\" he jokes. A blast of chill, putrid air wafts through the cave like the exhale of a monstrous beast, with you down its throat. \"Well, for what it is worth, I sure am glad to have you here,\" the explorer admits, a quiver of hesitation in his voice. \"Look—\" he points ahead at a fork in the tunnel. The foul gust dies down around you, but it clearly came from the left-hand path. \"Something that way is circulating air. That has to mean something, right?\" You nod in agreement, but you sure as hell don't like the smell of it…"

Breaking off in secret, heading back to the ice shelf, and getting as far away from this damned place as possible. But…\" she glances at the rest of the team, their mood hopeful despite the ominous feeling in the air. \"I would never make it back on my own. Do not worry. I am not going anywhere. Go ahead, take whatever is in that pack for yourself.\" You choose to trust her, though you cannot help but worry. Her usual monotone is full of jaded cynicism, but this is different. She sounds as though she has given up. \"Why are you still here?\" she asks after a long while. \"You have what you came for.\" You shake your head and tell her that you are here for her.
