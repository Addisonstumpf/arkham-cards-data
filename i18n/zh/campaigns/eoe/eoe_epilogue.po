"You find Ellsworth and Claypool on the aft deck of the Theodosia, enjoying a majestic view of the Atlantic. It has been several days since your escape, and the mood is one of relief, mixed with sorrow and guilt. The two men greet you as you approach, shifting aside to offer you a place to enjoy the view, as well. After a moment of contemplation, you ask what is in store for the explorers. The two of them share a knowing glance. \"A vacation, I think,\" Ellsworth says. \"A very, very long vacation.\"\n"
"\"Nothing but blue skies and warm air,\" Claypool suggests.\n"
"\"Sure. Somewhere that is on a map, preferably,\" Ellsworth adds with a gentle smile.\n"
"\"Really? I was thinking somewhere nice and remote. Just the two of us,\" Claypool hints.\n"
"You chuckle and leave the two of them to their vacation plans. Perhaps there is hope for the lot of you, after all."

"你看到埃爾斯沃思和克萊普爾在<b>菲奧多西亞號</b>的後甲板上，欣賞著大西洋的壯麗景色。你們逃離已經過去好幾天了，現在的心情是解脫中夾雜著悲傷和愧疚。當你走近時，這兩個男子向你打招呼，並讓出一個欣賞風景的位置給你。沉思片刻後，你詢問道，探險家們將面臨什麼。他倆交換了一個會意的眼神。“應該是度假吧，我想。”埃爾斯沃思說，“一個非常、非常長的假期。”\n"
"“只有藍色的天空和溫暖的空氣。”克萊普爾說。\n"
"“沒錯。最好是在地圖上有的地方。”埃爾斯沃思帶著溫和的微笑補充道。\n"
"“真的嗎？我想去個偏僻的好地方。就我們兩個。”克萊普爾暗示道。\n"
"你笑著離開了，留下他們倆繼續計畫他們的度假。看來，你們這些人或許還有希望。"

"You have seen Dr. Kensler face down impossible creatures and nightmarish environs, but it is this final trial that seems to rattle her most. She paces and fidgets and quietly recites sentences until finally, Dr. Sinha arrives. You'd leave her to her privacy, but she requested you stay. \"Mala,\" she says dryly, despite all of the practice. \"I was wondering—that is, I was—I would like to—\" she clears her throat and tries again. \"Would you like to have dinner again, sometime? And perhaps another show?\" she finally manages to say.\n"
"Dr. Sinha rolls her eyes, hiding a smile. \"Yes, you idiot.\"\n"
"Dr. Kensler blinks in surprise. You get the feeling she has never been called such a thing before.\n"
"\"Amy, you are highly astute, incredibly well read, and a true prodigy in your field. But when it comes to this—\" Dr. Sinha motions to and fro, indicating something in the air between them, \"you are somewhat of a dimwit.\"\n"
"To your surprise, Amy chuckles and grins. \"Yes. Yes, I suppose I am.\""

"你已經見識過肯斯勒博士如何面奇異生物和噩夢般的環境，但這最後的考驗反而讓她最手足無措。她坐立不安地踱著步子，靜靜地背誦句子，直到辛哈醫生終於到來。你不想打擾她，但她要求你留下。“瑪拉。”儘管練習了多次，她還是乾巴巴地說著。“我在想——也就是說，我——我想——”她清了清嗓子，又試了一次。“什麼時候再一起吃頓飯好嗎？或者再看場表演？”她最終努力說了出來。\n"
"辛哈醫生翻著白眼，掩飾著微笑。“好的，你這個傻瓜。”\n"
"肯斯勒博士驚訝地眨了眨眼睛。你感覺到她以前從來沒有被這樣稱呼過。\n"
"“艾米，你非常機敏，博覽群書，在你的領域是一個真正的天才。但當談到這個時——”辛哈醫生來回做了個手勢，暗示著她們之間的氣氛，“你有點像個傻瓜。”\n"
"令你驚訝的是，艾米露齒輕笑。“是的。是的，我想我確實是個笨蛋。”"

"Weeks later, you step into Professor Dyer's office, where he and Danforth study an array of old, musty tomes. Some kind of esoteric diagram, filled to the brim with bizarre symbols, adorns the professor's chalkboard. \"It could be this one,\" Dyer says quietly, pointing to a different diagram in one of the tomes. You recognize the book from Dr. Kensler's possessions, and several of the others from the restricted collection of the Orne Library.\n"
"Danforth closes his eyes. \"No, no, no…\" He moves to the chalkboard and begins to erase. \"It is different. Different, different…\" Only then do the two of them spot you in the entrance. You ask them what they're studying this time.\n"
"\"'In a future existence, we shall look upon what we think our present existence, as a dream,'\" Danforth recites from Poe once more, as if in explanation."
msgstr ""
"幾周後，你走進戴爾教授的辦公室，在那裡他和丹佛斯正研究著一堆發霉的古籍。教授的黑板上畫著某種深奧的圖表，上面滿是奇怪的符號。“可能是這個。”戴爾平靜地說著，指著其中一本書上一張不同的圖表。你認出了這本書來自於肯斯勒博士的收藏，另外還有幾本奧恩圖書館的限制收藏。\n"
"丹佛斯閉上了他的眼睛。“不、不、不……”他走上前開始擦黑板，“它是不同的。是不同的、不同的……”此時他們才發現你在門口。你詢問他們這次在研究什麼。\n"
"“‘在未來，我們將把我們所認為的現在，看作一個夢’。”丹佛斯又背誦了一遍愛倫·坡的作品，像是在解釋。"

msgid ""
"To your surprise, you spot both Takada and Cookie in the workshop below deck. Cookie has taken apart his revolver and is cleaning each piece individually, while Takada goes through the aeroplane parts the crew managed to break down during your hasty escape. You watch in secret for a short while as the two banter.\n"
"\"Hand me that cloth, will yeh?\"\n"
"\"I am not your employee, Cookie.\"\n"
"\"C'mon, Roko, it's right there. Jus' grab it and fling it over here.\"\n"
"\"Yes sir, do you wish for me to fetch you a spot of tea as well?\"\n"
"\"Very funny—why the hell'd you throw it all the way over there?\"\n"
"\"You told me to fling it.\"\n"
"\"To me, ya blasted—to me!\"\n"
"You smile to yourself as the back-and-forth continues. The unlikely duo seem more comfortable with one another than anybody else on the crew. Finally, a lull in the conversation gives you the opportunity to reveal yourself. They acknowledge your entrance with curt nods before going back to their work. You ask the pair what they intend to do when they get back to Arkham.\n"
"\"Roko wants to—you tell 'em,\" Cookie says.\n"
"Takada sighs and sits up, wiping sweat from her brow with the back of her gloved hand. \"I… I want to try to look for my father. I have asked Mr. Fredericks to join me.\" The two of them share a knowing glance. \"It is a long shot, I know. He likely crashed into the ocean many years ago. Even so, I want—I need to know. I have his logs. We should be able to find evidence. Something.\"\n"
"\"An' if not,\" Cookie adds, \"still better than sittin' around, waiting to be sent on another fool's errand like this one.\"\n"
"You nod and excuse yourself. As long as they have each other, you think the two of them will be all right."

"令你驚訝的是，你發現高田和曲奇都在甲板下面的工作間裡。曲奇拆開了他的左輪手槍，正在逐個清洗零件，而高田則在檢查你們匆忙逃離期間機組人員弄壞的飛機部件。你偷偷地看了一會兒這兩個人互相打趣。\n"
"“把那塊布遞來，行不？”\n"
"“我不是你的手下，曲奇。”\n"
"“得了，小弘，就在你那。抓著它往這一飛就行了。”\n"
"“是，長官，要不要再給你泡杯茶？”\n"
"“真好笑——你為啥扔那邊去了？”\n"
"“你叫我讓它飛的啊。”\n"
"“往我這啊，你這該對著我啊！”\n"
"在他們像這樣鬥嘴時，你暗自笑著。這對看著完全不合拍的搭檔似乎比團隊其他成員相處得更融洽。最後，談話的間歇，你終於有機會現身了。你一進門，他們就簡單地點點頭，然後繼續工作。你問他倆回到阿卡姆後打算做什麼。\n"
"“小弘想要——還是你來說吧。”曲奇說。\n"
"高田嘆了口氣，坐了起來，用戴著手套的手背抹去額頭上的汗水。“我……我想要試著尋找我的父親。我邀請了弗雷德里克斯先生陪我一起去。”他倆交換了一個會意的眼神。“我知道希望渺茫。他可能在多年前就已經墜海了。即便如此，我還是想——我還是需要知道。我有他的日誌。我們應該能找到證據。找到什麼。”\n"
"“就算沒有。”曲奇補充說，“也比坐著乾等，等待被派去做另一件像這樣的傻事要好。”\n"
"你點頭並告辭。只要他們有彼此支援，你覺得他倆都會沒事的。"

"Eliyah sits next to the railing near the bow of the ship, his stare distant and troubled. Anyu lays on the deck with him, her head resting on his lap. She is the first to spot your approach, but neither one of them greets you. You say nothing and sit nearby, staring off into the horizon in silence.\n"
"\"It happened again, Anyu,\" he mutters at last, his voice gravelly. \"Everyone is gone. Everyone but us. Why? Why is it always us?\"\n"
"You tell Eliyah it's because the two of them are survivors, like you. Too stubborn to die. He shakes his head.\n"
"\"No. It is a curse. A burden.\" He pets Anyu softly. The dog lifts her head and gazes at you pleadingly. \"I should be dead. Twice over, now.\"\n"
"But that isn't true, you insist. And besides, he has kept Anyu safe this whole time—is that not reason enough to live?\n"
"\"No, it's the other way around,\" he says, a smile threatening to tug on his lips. \"She's the one who saved me that day. She's the one who saves me every day.\""

"伊里亞坐在船頭附近的欄杆旁，他的目光看向遠方，充滿不安。安雨躺在他旁邊，頭枕在他的腿上。她最先發現你靠近，但他們都沒有打招呼。你什麼也沒說，只是坐在旁邊，默默地凝視著遠方。\n"
"“又一次發生了，安雨。”他終於開口了，聲音沙啞。“所有人都死了。除了我們。為什麼？為什麼總是我們？”\n"
"你告訴伊里亞因為他倆都是生存者，跟你一樣。命硬，百折不撓。他搖了搖頭。\n"
"“不。這是詛咒。是負擔。”他輕輕地撫弄著安雨。大狗抬起頭，懇求地看著你。“我早該死了。現在是第二次了。”\n"
"但你堅持說事實並非如此。而且，他一直以來都好好保護著安雨——難道這還不能成為活下去的理由嗎？\n"
"“不，恰恰相反。”他說著，嘴角露出一絲微笑。“那天是她救了我。一直都是她在拯救我。”"
