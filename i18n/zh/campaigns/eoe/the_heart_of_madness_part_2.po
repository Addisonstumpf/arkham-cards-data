"The facility is even older—and stranger—beyond the threshold of the ancient gateway. Who knows how many eons this place has slept undisturbed while the Earth changed and developed on the other side? Perhaps it would have remained so forever, had the site not been disturbed. But it's too late to change the past. All you can do now is work to prevent a terrible future.\n"
"Dim luminescence fills the eerie halls, powered by some form of advanced energy, like electricity. Behind you, a kaleidoscopic wall of miasma stitches itself together to block your escape. You are trapped here, perhaps forever. A web of expansive halls extends outward from the gateway, carved from smooth stone and covered in ancient murals and alien heiroglyphs. The air here feels thinner. The light bends and oscillates, distorting your vision like an optical illusion. Is this reality… or a mirage?\n"
"Your party studies the murals along the walls for many hours. They depict an ancient, unfamiliar history. An alternative history of the Earth. A very different history than any you could have possibly imagined."

"遠古大門另一端的設施甚至更為古老和奇異。誰能知道當地球在另一端在不斷變化發展的時候，此處有多少億年沒有被打擾過了？如果這個地點沒有受到打擾，也許它會永遠保持這樣的狀態。但現在已經太遲了，你們無法改變過去。你現在所能做的就是努力防止可怕的未來。\n"
"昏暗的光線充滿了詭異的大廳，由某種先進的能量驅動，類似電能。在你身後，一堵千變萬化的瘴氣縫合的牆擋住了你的出路。你被困在了這裡，可能是永遠。寬闊的大廳從大門向外延伸，由光滑的石頭雕刻而成，上面覆蓋著古代壁畫和異星文字。這裡的空氣感覺更稀薄。光彎曲振盪著，像視錯覺般扭曲你的所見。這是現實……還是幻景？\n"
"你的團隊花了好幾個小時研究牆上的壁畫。它們描繪了一段古老而陌生的歷史。地球的另一段歷史。一段你完全想像不到的歷史。"

"Dr. Kensler explains everything as she studies the ancient murals. \"The Elder Things were travelers. Colonizers. They came to the Earth over a billion years ago,\" she says, citing Professor Dyer's own notes. \"But they were not the first ones here. This place, all of this—it was ancient even then.\" She runs her hands along the mural as she explains what she has learned. \"But it is not an entity trapped within.\"\n"
"You ask what she means, alarmed by this new understanding. She turns to face you, her eyes aflame with inspiration. \"I had been studying their physiology, attempting to discern how they could exist the way they do, without shape, without matter, without state. But I was going about it all wrong. One cannot study the biology of something inorganic. See, it is not a creature, not truly. It is more akin to…\" she hesitates, attempting to find the right words. \"It is an alternate dimension. Another reality, superimposed on ours. A sentient microcosm of all that is. Not composed of organic life, but a mockery of it.\"\n"
"This newfound understanding of the phantasms you have encountered and the mirages you have seen put everything into context. They were not monsters you were slaying, they were figments of a false reality. One that may yet come to pass. You ask Dr. Kensler if there is any hope to stop such a force from escaping.\n"
"\"It is not a living thing. It cannot be killed. Only contained. The Elder Thing's facility held five pylons that used its essence to power their civilization, but after this long, I cannot imagine they still function. But perhaps…\" she trails off, formulating a plan. Finally, her eyes widen with realization. \"I know what must be done. I know how to stop it. You must find these pylons and destroy them—doing so will bring the entire compound down. In the meantime…\" she hefts her backpack off of her shoulder, dropping it to the ground. \"I… I must be off now. There is no time to spare.\"\n"
"You object to her sudden departure, but her mind is made up. She backs away, giving one last lingering glance at her companions, before sprinting away. You hope she knows what she's doing… for all of your sakes."

"肯斯勒博士一邊研究古代壁畫，一邊解釋了一切。“這些古老者是旅者。殖民者。它們在十多億年前就來到了地球。”她引用戴爾教授的筆記說，“但它們不是最早到達這兒的。這個地方，所有這一切——在那時都是遠古的存在。”她一邊用手摸著壁畫，一邊解釋她瞭解到的東西。“但這個存在並非被困於此。”\n"
"你問她這是什麼意思，你被這種新的理解嚇到了。她轉過身來面對著你，眼睛閃耀著智慧的光芒。“我一直在研究它們的生理，試圖辨別它們是如何以它們現在的方式存在的，沒有形狀、沒有物質、沒有狀態。但我的想法全錯了。無機物哪來的生物學呢。看，它都不是個生物，不是真實的。它更像是……”她猶豫了一下，試圖找到合適的詞語，“它是另一個維度。另一種現實，疊加在我們的現實上。所有這一切都是一個有意識的微觀宇宙。它不是由有機生命組成的，只是在模仿有機體而已。\n"
"對你所遇到的幽靈和你所看到的幻景的全新解釋，使一切都說得通了。它們不是被你殺死的怪物，它們只是虛假現實中的虛假之物。而這虛假卻將可能成為現實。你詢問肯斯勒博士，是否還有希望阻止這股力量逃跑。\n"
"“它不是活物。它不能被殺死。只能被控制。古老者的設施裡有五個高塔，在利用它的精華為它們的文明提供動力，但過了這麼久，恐怕它們已無法工作了。但也許……”她說到這裡，開始制定一個計畫。終於，她睜大眼睛表示想通了。“我知道必須要做什麼了。我知道該怎麼阻止它。你必須找到這些塔並摧毀它們——這樣做會摧毀這整個區域。與此同時……”她把背包從肩上卸下，扔到了地上。“我……我現在必須得走了。沒有時間可以浪費了。”\n"
"你反對她的突然離開，但她已經下定了決心。她後退了幾步，躊躇地看了同伴最後一眼，然後飛快地跑開了。看在你們所有人的份上……你希望她知道自己在做什麼。"

"You can glean only a fraction of the truth hidden within these ancient murals, but what you discover is almost too impossible to believe. When the Elder Things came to the Earth over a billion years ago, they colonized not just Antarctica, but the entirety of the planet. And when they did, this place—and the entity that dwells within—was already here.\n"
"They built their complex around it, to study the primordial being within, to greater understand it, and in doing so, attracted forces beyond even their ken. The gateway and its seals were constructed to contain it, but ages of disrepair have left it weak and ineffective. You suspect it was the presence of intelligent life on Antarctica—the humans who began to explore its long-dead peaks and icy plains—that stirred the entity within.\n"
"The murals tell of the facility's structure, of five pylons created not only to contain the creature's essence, but to power the whole of Elder Thing civilization. You can only imagine that destroying these pylons would reduce the entire compound—perhaps even the entirety of the mountain it is built beneath—to rubble. You don't know if you can truly destroy or contain this nameless horror, but you have no choice but to try. If it continues to escape, the very concept of reality will be rewritten to its whim. There will be nothing left but the mirage. Nothing left but twisted, horrid imagination. A nightmare from which there is no awakening."

"在這些古代壁畫中，你只能收集到隱於其中的一小部分真相，但你的發現已經幾乎令人難以置信了。當古老者在十多億年前來到地球時，它們不僅殖民了南極，還殖民了整個地球。而當它們做著這些的時候，這裡——以及住在裡面的存在——其實早就在了。它們在它周圍建造了建築群，以研究內部的遠古存在，從而更好地瞭解它。而在這過程中，吸引了甚至超出它們所知的力量。大門和封印是用來控制它的，但年久失修使它變得衰弱失效。你懷疑是因為南極洲上智慧生命的出現——開始探索其長期沉寂的山峰和冰原的人類——喚醒了潛藏於此的存在。\n"
"壁畫說明了這個設施的結構，五座塔的建造不僅是為了控制那生物的本質，還為整個古老者文明提供動力。你只能想到，摧毀這些塔將會使整個區域——甚至可能使它所在的整座山——變成廢墟。你不知道你是否能真正摧毀或遏制這無名的恐怖，但你別無選擇，只能嘗試。如果它繼續逃離，現實的概念本身將被它隨心所欲地改寫。現實中除了幻景，其他什麼都不會有了。除了扭曲可怕的想像，什麼都不會有了。只有永遠無法醒來的噩夢。"

"When you awaken, the facility is dark and quiet once more. You pull your companions to their feet and retreat back to the surface, wondering if you are too late to stop the entity beyond the gate from escaping.It is quiet. Peaceful. There are no more signs of icy phantasms, eerie mirages, or alien entities.\n"
"Back in the city nestled within the mountains, you take notes, photographs, and rubbings. The trip back to the ice shelf is swift and easy. Not even the cold weather fights you as you make your way back to the barrier camp. It is as if the entire continent of Antarctica has given itself over to you. You consider taking this time to continue studying the environment, but in the end, you decide to head back with your extensive findings. The sky is clear and beautiful as your ship departs from the ice shelf, heading north.\n"
"Still, you are troubled. The entity that was once sealed beyond the Elder Thing's gateway was gone. There was almost no trace of it when you fled. Which can only mean it escaped, and could be anywhere. Or everywhere. Your thoughts turn dreadful. You remind yourself of the strange, vivid mirages the creature seemed to control.

"不過，你還是有點不安。那個曾經被封印在古老者所建大門彼端的實體已經不在了。你逃跑的時候幾乎沒有看到任何它的痕跡。這只能說明它已經逃脫了，而它可能在任何地方。或者說一切地方。你越想越害怕。你回想起這個生物控制著的奇異生動的幻景。那些逼真的幻覺。你看著你的手掌，想知道它們就是原本的模樣，還是近似的複製品。你周圍的空氣在閃爍著微光。\n"

"Suddenly, there is blast of warm air, and a sound like a tremendous exhalation. The air shimmers with the distortion of a mirage, and you watch in shock as the rushing miasma suddenly recoils. It collapses upon itself and retreats back into the mountainside just as the avalanche begins. Bright blue cracks spread rapidly along the walls. Without the pylons, the integrity of not just the facility within the mountain, but the entire city, is compromised. The icy floor cracks open. The cyclopean architecture of the alien city begins to sink into the snow.\n"
"Then you hear it: the roaring engine of an aeroplane overhead. The last of Takada's three planes soars over the city, and familiar shouts echo throughout the ancient, ruinous streets. \"There they are! By that tunnel! Quickly!\" Two sledges slide into view, pulled by the remainder of the dogs Eliyah left at the barrier camp, and manned by several members of the crew of the Theodosia. You cannot hold back your surprise or joy at the sight. They motion frantically for you to join them, their gazes fixed on the collapsing mountain.\n"
"At the last possible second, you hear another voice emanating from within the tunnel. \"Wait!\" Dr. Kensler emerges from the darkness, waving and hollering. \"Wait for me!\" She hops onto the sledge, and together, you race off into the foothills as the city collapses into the ice behind you.\n"
"One of the crewmates explains that they fixed up the last of the aeroplanes and decided to use it to look for you, even knowing the risks. \"When we spotted you entering that huge cavern without most of your gear, we thought you might need a rescue. Didn't expect that to be quite this literal,\" he says. You tell him his timing couldn't be more perfect.\n"
"The moment you make it back to the ice shelf, Dr. Kensler instructs the crew to prepare for departure. You barely even break down the barrier camp. It doesn't matter anymore. All that matters is getting out of this place with your lives intact—and with all the evidence you have found, of course.\n"
"But still, you have questions. Once safely aboard the Theodosia, you confront Dr. Kensler and ask her what she did back in the facility. The entity was chasing you, and then, suddenly… \"I told you, it is not a living creature,\" she explains. \"As such, it cannot be killed. At least, not by our standards. But it has some semblance of sentience, yes? It knows our desires. Our hopes. Our fears.\" You note aloud that Dr. Kensler is using the present tense. She clenches her jaw. The slightest hint of distortion wavers in the air around her. \"I… I made a deal,\" she whispers. \"It was the only way.\""

You dare not turn and glimpse that which has haunted Danforth these many months, but still you hear it to this day: echoing shrieks and fathomless cries, winds too shrill and piercing to be natural, and whispers that beckon you to return.\n"
"It has been years since that fateful day. You have not told the greater scientific community anything of your journey. And yet, still, there is no sign of the escaped entity. Is its reach limited to that cryptic,frozen continent? Is it simply biding its time?\n"
"Or is it already here, in the very air you breathe? Inside your mind? Showing you a false reality? A mirage?"

"當你從拱門下逃走時，山脈開始怒吼，隆隆作響。你摧毀了足夠多的高塔，威脅到了城市深處設施的結構完整性，但這還不夠。你會死在這裡，更糟糕的是，你的作為只是在幫助那個存在逃脫。\n"
"然後你聽到了：頭頂上飛機引擎的轟鳴。高田三架飛機中僅存的那架，正在城市上空盤旋，熟悉的喊聲迴蕩在古老的破敗街道上。“他們在那兒！在隧道旁邊！快！”兩輛雪橇滑進了視野，由伊里亞留在屏障營地裡的其餘隨行犬拉著，載著幾名<b>菲奧多西亞號</b>的船員。看到這一幕，你情不自禁地鬆了口氣。他們瘋狂地示意你上來，而他們的眼睛緊盯著正在漸漸滲出的恐怖瘴氣。“那到底是什麼鬼東西？”其中一人喊道。但沒有時間解釋了。你一登上雪橇，就命令他開始逃跑。\n"
"你對逃離城市的記憶瘋狂而模糊。你依稀記得，你在積雪覆蓋的古老街道上穿梭，躲避著石灰色的光滑建築物周圍蠕動的霧氣，你在山間穿行時，勉強地避開了一團五彩斑斕的黏液。\n"
"那個生物消失於你們的視線外後，一名成員解釋說，他們修好了最後一架飛機，決定用它來找你們，即使知道風險很大。“當我們發現你們幾乎沒有帶裝備就進入了那個巨大洞穴時，我們認為你們可能需要救援。沒想到我們的預料成真了。”他說。\n"
"看到飛行員把最後一架飛機成功降落在山脈另一邊，你鬆了一口氣。你和救援人員到達後，帶著剩下的隨行犬一起立即匆忙登上飛機。在遠處，你可以看到那個存在若隱若現，爬上參差不齊的山峰，直插雲霄。\n"
"你丟下了雪橇和所有的補給。引擎轟鳴著啟動，你們一起離開這瘋狂的山脈。你不敢轉過身去瞥一眼那幾個月來一直困擾著丹佛斯的東西，但直到今天你仍然能聽到它：迴響著的尖叫聲和無法言語的哭聲，太過尖聲刺耳而不自然的風，還有召喚你回去的低語。\n"
"從那災難般的日子算起，已經過去很多年了。你還未把你的旅程的任何内容告訴科學界。然而，仍然沒有那存在逃脫的任何跡象。它的活動範圍是否局限於那片神秘的冰封大陸？還是說它只是在等待時機？\n"
"還是它已經在這裡了，就在你呼吸的空氣裡？進入了你的思想？向你展示著虛假的現實？一個幻景？"
