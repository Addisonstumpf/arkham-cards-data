"After two weeks and many hours of hard work, the expedition is ready to make its first foray into the cold, dead continent of Antarctica. Ms. Takada, along with two other mechanics, have fully assembled three aeroplanes along the flat ice shelf—a perfect place for takeoffs and landings. Your team congregates by the aeroplanes, along with several days' worth of camping equipment. The plan is to fly two of the planes over the vast jagged peaks, taking aerial photographs of the stone city mentioned in Dyer's account… that is, if such a thing really exists.\n"
"\"If we can find a safe landing zone, we will set up a temporary outpost,\" Dr. Kensler explains. \"Dyer, Danforth, Fredericks, and Claypool will stick around while the rest of us head back to base camp. We can use the sledges to ferry supplies to and from the camps. Otherwise, we'll simply scout out the area and head back to base camp.\" The team nods in agreement and begins boarding the planes."

"兩周後，經過許久的艱苦工作，探險隊已經準備好首次進入寒冷、死寂的南極大陸。高田女士和另外兩名技師已經在平坦的冰架上組裝好了三架飛機，那裡是起飛和降落的完美地點。你的團隊聚集在飛機旁，旁邊還放著可供幾天用的露營裝備。計畫是讓兩架飛機飛越巨大的鋸齒山峰，從空中拍下戴爾敘述中提到的石城的照片……前提是，如果那東西真的存在的話。\n"
"“如果我們能找到一塊安全的著陸區，我們會搭建一個臨時的前哨基地。”肯斯勒博士解釋說，“戴爾、丹佛斯、弗雷德里克斯，還有克萊普爾會留在那兒，其他人回大本營。我們可以用雪橇在營地間來回運送補給。不然，我們就簡單地偵察一下這個地區，然後返回大本營。”隊員們點頭同意，然後開始登機。"

"\"Buckle up,\" you tell the others as you spin the propeller and hop into the pilot's seat. You motion to the pilot of the other plane, and both of you start your engines. One at a time, you take off from the ice shelf and soar into the opaque fog. You have never flown a plane of this size, but but it's no match for your piloting skills. Within moments you have a handle on the beast's clunky controls. The weather is another matter entirely. The rough Antarctic winds and harsh fog make for poor flying conditions. The deeper you head through the beautiful and deceptive polar mirages, the more you struggle to keep a handle on the aeroplane.\n"
"Dr. Kensler peers out a window as you pass a magnificent view of distant mountains like vibrant, enchanted castles floating above the clouds. \"They're beautiful,\" she remarks quietly.\n"
"\"These are nothing,\" Dyer begins, \"Wait until you see-\" And then the storm hits. The winter winds are so sudden and fierce that they almost force you out of your seat. Both planes shunt to and fro in the horrid winds, and you hear several of the passengers shouting behind you.\n"
"\"What in the hell?\" Fredericks grunts.\n"
"\"We have to head back!\" Claypool shouts. \"These winds will force us down if we keep going!\"\n"
"\"We're so close!\" Dr. Kensler growls bitterly.\n"
"\"We don't have a choice!\" he yells back, but it's too late. The plane lurches toward the ground, and you struggle in vain to regain control. All of the passengers notice the dark shape in the sky at the same time you do. It is a massive shadow, like a curtain drawn across the mountains, or perhaps the tattered wings of an antediluvian behemoth. It scowls at you with dreadful, hollow eyes. Then it reaches out, and—"

msgid "No amount of preparation could have made your journey through the ice and cold any easier. Your months of training before the expedition kicked in the moment you became stranded, and you were even able to scavenge some supplies while you searched for a safe place to rest for the night… but your thoughts keep returning to the sight of the thing that made your plane crash, the horrifying abominations that pursued you through the snowy wastes, and the sound—that awful sound, that cry! You almost wish you could have been robbed of your senses altogether so as to spare you from the cry that now haunts your every waking moment. As exhaustion settles in and you drift off to sleep, still that sound echoes in your thoughts, over and over again: Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!"
msgstr "再多的準備也無法使你在冰天雪地的旅途中變得輕鬆。探險前經受的數月訓練在你陷入困境時有了成效。在尋找安全的地方過夜時，你甚至還找到了一些補給……但你的思緒總是回到那個讓你墜機的東西，那個在雪地裡追著你的可怕東西，還有那個聲音——那個可怕的聲音，那個喊聲！有時你甚至希望你的感官能被完全剝奪，這樣你就不會像現在這樣，每時每刻都聽到縈繞著你的喊聲。當疲憊襲來，你漸入夢鄉時，那聲音仍在你的腦海中迴響，一遍又一遍：忒咳哩-哩！忒咳哩-哩！"

msgid "As you make camp, you are haunted by memories of the creatures you encountered in the icy wilds. Such entities should not exist. Not even Dyer's report mentions anything of the kind. Grim silence settles over the expedition team as you set up shelter. No one speaks of what they saw in the frozen wilderness. No one speaks of the awful sounds those monsters made. You can only hope that this camp is secluded enough to avoid the attention of those things- whatever they may be…"
msgstr "當你紮營時，你被冰冷荒野中遇到的生物的記憶所困擾。這種東西不應該存在。就連丹佛斯的報告中，也沒有任何地方提到過這種東西。當你搭建庇護所時，可怕的沉默籠罩著探險隊。沒人說起他們在冰凍荒野上看到了什麼。沒人說起那些怪物發出的可怕聲音。你只能希望這個營地足夠隱蔽，可以避免引起那些東西的注意——不管它們是什麼……"
