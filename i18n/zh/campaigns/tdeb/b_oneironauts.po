"<i>Following scenario 2–B, the investigators have finally reached the end of the mysterious stairway…</i>\n"
"The black cat awaits you at the bottom of the stairs, watching your long descent with distant, unblinking eyes. You are about to ask how the cat got there when it cuts you off. “Don’t bother. You wouldn’t understand.” It curls up on the cold stone floor, lounging amid the bleak environment."
msgstr ""
"<i>接著冒險2-B，調查員終於到達了神秘階梯的盡頭……</i>\n"
"黑貓在階梯底下等待著你的到來，它的眼神冷漠而堅定，看著你一步步地往下走。你正想問一隻貓是怎麼到這裡來的，它打斷了你。“不必問了。你不會明白的。”它在冰冷的石質地面上蜷作一團，懶洋洋地躺在這個荒涼的地方。"

msgid "<i>If Randolph did not survive the descent</i> and <i>the black cat has a hunch</i>:"
msgstr "如果<i>倫道夫在下降到地下世界的途中遇難</i>，並且<i>黑貓察覺到了什麼</i>："

msgstr "告訴《夢尋秘境》(劇本A)的調查員們，保留冒險日誌中<i>黑貓察覺到了什麼</i>的記錄。"

msgid "“Where’s blondie?” the black cat asks, peering around. You remain silent, in anguish. “Ah. I see.” The cat examines its paw. It doesn’t seem to care that your companion did not survive the descent. “Well, that seems to have resolved itself nicely,” it says to itself cryptically."
msgstr "“那個金髮小子在哪？”黑貓四處張望著問道。悲痛的你一言不發。“啊。我明白了。”貓看著自己的爪子說道。它似乎並不關心你同伴的安全。“嗯，看來問題自己解決了。”它神秘兮兮地自言自語。"

msgid "In both Campaign Logs, cross off <i>the black cat has a hunch</i>."
msgstr "在兩份冒險日誌中，劃去<i>黑貓察覺到了什麼</i>。"

msgid "“Well, since you clearly don’t need my help, I’ll be off now. Just wanted to check to see if you’re still alive. And look at that! You are. For now. Bye then.” Before you get the chance to reply, the black cat wanders off, its pitch-black fur melding into the darkness of the Underworld."
msgstr "“好吧，因為你顯然並不需要我的幫助，我會離開的。但我只想確認下你是不是還活著。看吶！你還活著，至今為止。那再見啦。”你還沒來得及應它的話，它就走開了，漆黑的毛色融入了地下世界的黑暗之中。"

msgid "You’ve about had it with this cat’s cryptic half-truths and nonanswers. You rail at the beast. How are you supposed to help when you might as well be stumbling in the dark? The black cat sits up and narrows its gaze. “I did not know if you could be trusted. To be honest, I am still unsure. I have had visions of these events for many, many years now. I know some of what may come to pass, but not everything. You could be the ones who will save all of us…or the fools who herald our doom.” The cat’s justification is convenient, but it does explain how it has known where to find you at every turn. You try to persuade the cat to trust you, but it remains unconvinced. “Tell you what. Beneath the surface of the Sea of Pitch lies a passageway between realms. That is where you need to go to stop this world from merging with yours. Make it there in one piece, and I’ll tell you everything. But first, I have somewhere else to be. Your pals need me, too.”"
msgstr "你已經受夠了這隻貓說話神神祕祕，半真半假，答非所問。你朝它抱怨：你也是一知半解，那你還怎麼幫我們？黑貓坐起身，眯起眼睛：“我當時不知道我是否信得過你。老實說，現在我也不清楚。早在很久很久以前，我就能看到這些事件的幻象。我知道可能會發生的一些事，但不是全部。你或許能拯救我們所有人……但也可能是預示我們末日到來的蠢貨。”黑貓的理由像是信手拈來，但確實解釋了它為什麼每次都知道在哪能找到你。你試圖說服它相信你，但你仍然無法取得它的信任。“我來告訴你吧。在漆黑之海的水面以下，有著兩界之間的通道。你必須到那兒去，阻止這個世界和你的世界相融。如果你能安然無恙地到達那兒，我會把一切都告訴你。但是，我得先到別的地方去。你的同伴們也需要我。”"

msgid "The black cat wanders off before you can reply, its pitch-black fur melding into the darkness of the Underworld."
