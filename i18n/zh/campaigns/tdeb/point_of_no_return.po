"You have finally reached the Dreamlands, but it is not as you expected. This cyclopean cavern is far from the wondrous lands and fabulous cities described in Virgil Gray’s writings. Perhaps the author never ventured this far underground, never found the horrors that lurk beneath the surface of the Dreamlands. You suspect he wouldn’t have left out tales of such a spine-chilling nature. As you venture into the dark and barren realm, you are filled with hollow despair—an emptiness that gnaws at your heart and mirrors the bleak landscape all around you. You came here to help your friends, and now your only guide through this realm is gone. What if this was all a horrible mistake?\n"
"You shake these dark thoughts from your mind and focus on the path that lies ahead of you. It’s too late to dwell on what you could have done differently. This is your way forward now. Even if you cannot help your friends, even if you are too late to help Randolph, you have another mission now. Clearly this region of the Dreamlands has something to do with the creatures invading your reality. The answers must lie here. Besides, it’s not like you have much choice anymore.\n"
"You walk to the edge of a jagged cliff overlooking the cavernous realm below. This realm is staggeringly vast. In the distance, along the cliffs, you see a walled city, of all things. Among its many towers, a black spire rises so high it must pierce the surface of the Dreamlands. To the south is a stretch of plains that looks over the vale below, and you can see shapes moving throughout the grey, phosphorescent light. You hope the beings who inhabit this realm are ones you might be able to reason with. You have your doubts…but at least now you have a plan. Whether or not it is a good plan remains to be seen."

"你終於來到了幻夢境，但這裡與你預想的並不一樣。眼前這個巨大的洞穴與維吉爾·格雷筆下的奇妙大陸、宏偉城市毫無關聯。或許作者從未來到如此遙遠的地下，也從未發現潛伏在幻夢境之下的恐怖。你覺得，他如果曾到過這裡，一定會把這毛骨悚然的畫面編撰成書。隨著你深入這片黑暗而貧瘠的地方，你內心充滿了空洞的絕望——這空虛的感覺折磨著你的心靈，映照著周圍荒涼的景象。你是來這兒幫助你的朋友們的，而你在這裡唯一的嚮導已經不在。你會不會是走錯了路，錯來到這可怕的地方？\n"
"你將這些黑暗的想法從腦海中揮散，專注於前方的道路。如今再去後悔當初的決定，為時已晚。你只需往前走。即便你沒能幫上朋友，沒能拯救倫道夫，但現在你有了新的使命。很顯然，幻夢境的這個區域和入侵現實世界的生物之間有著某種聯繫。答案一定就在這裡。而且，你也沒有別的選擇。\n"
"你走到了一個鋸齒狀的懸崖邊緣，俯瞰下方的洞穴國度。那裡廣闊得叫人吃驚。在遠處，你沿著懸崖看去，看到一座被圍牆包圍著的城市。在城中諸多高塔中，有一座黑色的尖塔向上延伸，像是要刺穿幻夢境的地面。南面是一片連綿的平原，俯瞰著下方的山谷，你可以看到一些身影在灰色的磷光中移動。你希望居住在這個國度的生物能跟你講講道理。你心中還有疑問……但至少現在你有了計劃。這計劃是好是壞，尚未可知。"

"You have finally reached the Dreamlands, but it is not as you expected. This cyclopean Underworld is far from the wondrous lands and fabulous cities described in Virgil Gray’s writings. Perhaps the author never ventured this far underground, never found the horrors that lurk beneath the surface of the Dreamlands. You suspect he would not have left out tales of such a spine-chilling nature. As you venture into the dark, barren realm, you raise your concerns with Randolph. “It is true that we are farther from your companions than we intended, he affirms. “However, if I may offer another sentiment—perhaps this is a blessing in disguise. Clearly the Underworld has something to do with the creatures invading our reality. I suggest we investigate further while we have the chance. We can return to the surface of the Dreamlands once we have discovered the truth.”\n"
"You ask Randolph if he has any leads, and he steps to the edge of a jagged cliff overlooking the cavernous realm below. “I have been here before,” he says quietly, getting his bearings. “Those walls in the distance belong to the City of Gugs. To the south is a stretch of plains that looks over the vale below. That plain is where the ghouls live. Perhaps there we can learn more.” You raise your doubts aloud, wondering if such creatures are even capable of peaceful conversation. “They are more intelligent than you think, and could be quite helpful if we convince them to aid us. In fact, there is one I count among my friends, an artist by the name of Richard Pickman. If we are fortunate enough to find him, that might be our best chance.” You still have your doubts…but at least now you have a plan. Whether or not it is a good plan remains to be seen."

"你問倫道夫他是不是知道些什麼，他走到了一個鋸齒狀的懸崖邊緣，俯瞰下方的洞穴國度。“我曾經到過這裡。”他靜靜地說道，一邊試圖搞清楚自己的方位，“遠方的高牆之下是古革巨人之城。南面則是一片連綿的平原，俯瞰著下方的山谷。那片平原是食尸鬼居住的地方。或許我們到那裡可以瞭解更多。”你問出了心中的疑問：“那些生物也能和我們友好交流嗎？”“它們比你想象中的更聰明，要是我們能說服它們，它們甚至還能幫上我們的忙。事實上，我有一位名叫理查德·皮克曼的朋友，他是個畫家。要是能找到他，我們或許就能十拿九穩。”你心中還有疑問……但至少現在你們有了計劃。這計劃是好是壞，尚未可知。"

"You brace yourself as another wave of distorted reality crashes into you. This feeling, whatever it is, is growing stronger as time marches on. Someone or something is causing it, but how? Just as you are pondering its meaning, you realize something curious: you aren’t the only one affected. Far from it, in fact; the entirety of the Underworld seems to be changing with each wave of warped energy that flows through the realm. Walls shift, the floor skews, and the dim, phosphorescent light scintillates with a cosmic, otherworldly glow. The ground rumbles as another wave of force rushes through the foundations of the dream world. The rocky surface upon which you stand gives way. You flail in the air, attempting to grab hold of something, anything that you can use to pull yourself up. Your hands wrap around a painted plank of wood. You have no time to question its appearance—survival comes first.\n"
"When you pull yourself up, you realize you are curled up on a park bench, surrounded by a thick fog and the grim, gambrel rooftops of Arkham. There is no ground in front of you. Just an open, endless pit into fathomless depths. The Underworld, perhaps? But how is that possible? Virgil’s cat watches you casually from a tree branch that hangs over the park bench. “It won’t stop,” the black cat tells you. “Not until there is nothing left of your world.” You wonder what you could possibly do in the face of such horror. The cat gazes down into the pit below. “It’s waiting for you.”\n"
"Another rumble. In the distance, you watch with horror as an entire building is sucked into the ground. You think you spot a pedestrian in the distance, but it is no human. If this goes on any longer, your companions won’t have a world to awaken to. You steel yourself, look down into the empty pit, and gulp. “Down you go,” the cat says.\n"
"You fall. The roar of the wind is deafening as it whips by your head. You can’t possibly survive a fall like this, you think. But instead of splattering against a hard, rocky ground, you are caught by a glowing, sinewy web. Panicking, you scramble to a nearby platform made of solid rock. Your refuge is one of many, each suspended in the air and connected by thick webbing. Beyond that is a vast, cosmic space, an infinite darkness that stretches as far as the eye can see."

"你做好準備，隨即受到扭曲的現實帶來的又一波衝擊。不論這感覺是什麼，它正隨著時間的流逝變得越來越強烈。這種感覺的出現一定有其緣由，但那緣由是什麼呢？就在你思考其意義時，你注意到異常：你並不是唯一一個受這感覺影響的人。實際上，其影響遠不止於此：整個地下世界彷彿都在隨著每一波流經這裡的扭曲能量而改變。牆壁移動，地板傾斜，昏暗的磷光閃爍著來自宇宙的詭異光芒。隨著夢境世界的大地湧過又一波能量，地面隆隆作響，你腳下的岩石地面開始塌陷。你雙手在空中掙扎，試圖抓住什麼來避免跌落。你緊緊纏抱住一塊上了漆的木板。你無暇深究這塊木板怎麼會出現在這裡——活命要緊。\n"
"當你爬起身來，你發現自己在公園的長椅上蜷曲著身體，周圍能看到濃霧和阿卡姆令人不快的複折屋頂。你面前沒有地面。只有一個無邊無際的深坑，通向無底的深淵。或許，這就是“地下世界”？但這怎麼可能呢？在長椅上方的一根樹枝上，維吉爾的貓漠不關心地看著你：“這一切不會停下。”黑貓對你說，“直到你的世界一無所有。”你想道，面對這般恐怖，你究竟能做些什麼。貓盯著下方的深坑。“它在等著你。”\n"
"又是一聲巨響。你驚恐地看到遠處整幢建築被吸入地下。你看到遠處有個身影在走動，但那並不是人類。如果這種情況再繼續下去，整個世界都將不復存在，你的同伴也無從醒來。你下定決心，朝空蕩蕩的深坑看去，深吸一口氣。“下去吧。”黑貓說道。\n"
"於是你縱身躍下。咆哮的風震耳欲聾，迎面吹來像是在抽打著你的頭臉。你心想，像這樣下墜絕對會要了你的命。但你並未在堅硬的岩石地面上摔成肉醬，而是被一張發光巨網結結實實地接住。你驚慌失措，爬到旁邊一個岩石平臺上。你所在的平臺漂浮在空中，周圍還有很多同樣的地方，它們之間連接著厚厚的網。在那後面，是廣闊的宇宙太空，目之所及是無盡的黑暗。"
