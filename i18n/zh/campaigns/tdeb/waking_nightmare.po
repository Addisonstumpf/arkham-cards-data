msgid ""
"It has been more than twenty-four hours since your companions fell asleep. Over the course of the past day, your curiosity has slowly turned to concern and then dread. The problems began when one of your friends started to toss and turn violently in their sleep. You snapped to attention and tried to shake them awake, but it was to no avail. You tried everything. Physical contact was no use, and water did nothing but soak their clothes and bed fruitlessly. Even opening their eyelids did not wake them, and in the process, you noticed that their pupils had fully dilated and their eyes were glazed over with a milky-white fog.\n"
"You have no idea what this could mean for your friends. Have they managed to find their way to the land Virgil Gray described in his writings? Or has something more sinister taken root within their minds and bodies? Just to be safe, you decide to take your companions to St. Mary’s Hospital. If something ails them physically, perhaps the doctors there can discern what is wrong. Otherwise, you will simply have to watch over them and hope that they return safely to the waking world.\n"
"St. Mary’s is the only hospital in the town of Arkham, and it is a fixture of its Uptown neighborhood. You explain the situation to Nurse Greenberg, the head nurse at the hospital, who instructs several other nurses to carry your companions into the emergency ward on stretchers. She tells you with a warm, friendly smile that your friends will be examined by Doctor Maheswaran, but other than that, you are left entirely in the dark.\n"
"Hours pass. You hear nothing about the status of your companions. You still have not met with Doctor Maheswaran, and you’re starting to grow impatient. You feel something crawling along your arm, and you instinctively brush it away, then wonder if it was an insect or a figment of your imagination. You begin to question whether bringing your friends here was the right choice after all. Eventually, you decide to take matters into your own hands.\n"
"It is late at night, and the receptionist who instructed you to stay in the waiting room is nowhere to be seen. In fact, there are eerily few people roaming the halls of the hospital. With nobody to stop you, you sneak off into the emergency ward to find your friends. It does not take long for you to find their room. Your companions lie asleep on clean, white cots, their sleep anything but peaceful. They are pale faced and sweaty. One of them tosses and turns in their sleep, their brow furrowed with pain or worry.\n"
"Doctor Maheswaran does not seem surprised by your intrusion. “Shivani Maheswaran,” she introduces herself coldly, without looking up from her clipboard. “You’re the ones who brought them in, right? Before you ask: no, I’ve never seen anything like this before in my life,” she says with a hint of dry impatience. You demand that she tell you everything she knows about their condition and not give you the runaround. With a sigh, she puts her clipboard down and addresses you frankly. “Listen, I may be new to Arkham, but I have seen enough inexplicable maladies in this town to fill entire careers in medicine. I understand why you are concerned. Your friends…” She struggles to find the right words. “They are not simply asleep. It is as if they are hovering somewhere between sleep and unconsciousness, or even death. They are not aware of anything happening around them but appear to be reacting to some kind of internal stimuli.”\n"
"Without hesitation, you ask if they are dreaming. “Dreaming?” Doctor Maheswaran replies. “It is unlikely, though it might account for their mannerisms. Honestly—and I know this is not exactly reassuring— none of this makes any sense to me, medically speaking.”\n"
"Just then, you see a large, hairy spider crawling on the chest of one of your friends. “Well, that is odd.” Doctor Maheswaran brushes the spider off, and several more emerge from the sheets to take its place. You and the doctor both take several steps back out of pure instinct. You hear heavy footsteps in the hallway outside the emergency ward, and then the lights begin to flicker. “Okay…that is more than simply odd. What in the world is going on out there?” Doctor Maheswaran asks anxiously.\n"
"For just a moment, you think you hear one of your sleeping companions whisper something. Are they indeed dreaming? And if so, what does their condition have to do with these strange events?"

"你的同伴們已經沉睡超過24個小時了。在過去的一天裡，你的好奇慢慢變成了擔憂，進而變成恐懼。一開始讓你注意到的是，你的其中一位朋友在睡夢中激烈地輾轉反側。你立馬打起精神，試圖把他們搖醒，但是他們並沒有反應。你試遍了一切法子。怎麼碰都不管用，用水也只是弄溼了他們的衣服和床鋪，完全弄不醒他們。甚至你扒開他們的眼皮也沒法讓他們醒來，但這時你發現他們的眼睛已經失去了神采，像是蒙了一層乳白色的濃霧。\n"
"你不知道這對你的朋友們來說意味著什麼。他們是不是找到了維吉爾·格雷筆下的那個地方？還是說有某些邪物扎根在他們的精神和肉體裡了？為了安全起見，你決定把你的同伴們帶到聖瑪麗醫院。如果問題出在他們的身體，那麼或許那裡的醫生可以診斷出來。如果不是，那你只能看護他們，祈望他們平安回到清醒世界。\n"
"作為阿卡姆鎮上的唯一一所醫院，聖瑪麗醫院就坐落在住宅區。你向這所醫院的護士長格林伯格說明情況，於是她讓幾名護士用擔架把你的同伴們抬進了急診病房。她帶著友善溫暖的笑容對你說，馬斯沃倫醫生將會為你的朋友們作檢查，但除此之外，你像被蒙在鼓裡。\n"
"過去了數個小時。你完全不知道你同伴們現在的情況。你還沒見到馬斯沃倫醫生，開始逐漸失去耐心。你感覺到有什麼東西在你手臂上爬，你本能地把它趕走，然後你內心開始懷疑，那究竟是昆蟲還是你的假想。你開始產生疑問，把朋友們帶到這裡來究竟是不是正確的選擇。最後，你決定自己給這個問題找出答案。\n"
"時間已經很晚了，讓你待在候診室的接待護士已經不見蹤影。實際上，只有寥寥數人在醫院走廊上遊蕩，這情景讓人感到害怕。你偷偷溜了進去，要到急診病房尋找你的朋友，路上無人阻攔。沒花多少功夫，你就找到了他們在的病房。你的同伴們躺在乾淨的白色病床上睡著，但他們卻睡得一點也不舒坦。他們臉色蒼白，大汗淋漓。其中一人在睡夢中翻來覆去，眉頭深深皺起，不知是痛苦還是憂心。\n"
"馬斯沃倫醫生似乎對你的闖入並不驚訝。“席瓦妮·馬斯沃倫。”她冷冷地介紹自己，目光沒從寫字板抬起，“就是你帶他們入院的，對嗎？我可以直接回答你的問題：我不知道他們得了什麼病，我這輩子從沒見過這樣的病。”她的話語中帶著一絲焦躁。你問她關於你同伴的情況她都知道些什麼，要她把她知道的一切都告訴你，而不是搪塞你。她嘆了口氣，放下寫字板，坦誠地跟你說：“聽著，我或許對阿卡姆不太熟悉，但我在這座鎮上見過的疑難雜症多得夠我研究上一輩子。我知道你為什麼會擔心。你的朋友們……”她努力尋找合適的措辭，“他們並不是簡單的睡著。他們彷彿徘徊在睡眠與昏迷，甚至死亡之間。他們意識不到周圍發生的一切，但似乎會對某種內部刺激產生反應。\n"
"你毫不猶豫地問她，他們是不是在做夢。“做夢？”馬斯沃倫醫生重複道，“不太可能，但這或許能解釋他們的怪異行為。老實說——我知道這並不能讓你放心——從醫學角度說，這一切我都無法理解。\n"
"就在這時，你看到一隻毛茸茸的大蜘蛛正在你一個朋友胸口上爬著。“啊，這倒是奇怪。”馬斯沃倫醫生趕走了那隻蜘蛛，隨後又有好幾隻從床單裡冒出，爬到剛才的地方。你和醫生本能地後退了幾步。你聽到急診病房外的走廊傳來沉重的腳步聲，然後燈光開始閃爍。“好吧……這可不只是奇怪。外面到底發生什麼事了？”馬斯沃倫醫生焦急地問道。\n"
"有那麼一瞬間，你覺得自己聽見了一個熟睡中的朋友低聲說了些什麼。他們真的在作夢嗎？如果是，他們的情況和眼前這些怪事有何關聯？"

"With panic overtaking your mind and no idea how you can escape, you flee anywhere your feet will take you. Hideous monsters begin to close in around you, and you envision yourself wrapped in webs, waiting to be a spider’s meal. Eventually you come to a dead end: a room covered from floor to ceiling in thick, sticky webs. The skittering of spider legs follows close behind, and you realize you have no hope to escape unless there is a path behind the webs. There is no choice remaining for you. You run headlong into the webs, ripping and tearing at them with the ferocity of a cornered animal. It is tough work, but eventually you see a light behind the webs—perhaps an escape route.\n"
"Once you cross through the webs, you are no longer in the dark, sterile halls of St. Mary’s, but in a narrow, web-covered cavern. You dare not tarry or go back the way you came, so you run through the dark, cramped cave with no idea where it might lead. Glancing through the cobwebs to your left and right, you see not just hard rock, but the glimmering of lights, like a sea of stars looming beyond the silken threads. Eventually, you emerge from another wall of webs, only to find yourself in an alleyway in Arkham’s Merchant District, near the Miskatonic River. You have neither the time nor the desire to analyze this, instead deciding to put as much distance as you can between you and the hospital. The moment you get home, you collapse from exhaustion.\n"

Randolph ponders this for a moment, then replies: “Normally, dreamers can return to the real world simply by willing themselves awake, but for some reason, your friends are unable to do so. If you truly wish to help them, you too must enter the Dreamlands and find them. But forcing your way into the Dreamlands is not easy. Such paths are usually accessible only to experienced dreamers, and only in sleep. Still, there are some places where the Dreamlands touch the waking world, and in those places, with the right tools, you may enter the Dreamlands in your physical body. I know of such a place, not far from here. However—”\n"
