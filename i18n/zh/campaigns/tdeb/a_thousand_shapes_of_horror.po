"To stop the merging between the land of dreams and the waking world, you decide to force your way into the “Dreamlands”—as your new companion Randolph calls the dimension—in your physical body, instead of traveling there in your sleep. “While there are many dangers to this method of travel, I think it is better than the alternative,” Randolph claims. “If we venture there in our sleep, we may become trapped like your companions, unable to wake.” You agree: you can do little good trapped on the other side, especially if you aim to help your dreaming companions.\n"
"“Our first step is to find a key. Even in places where the Dreamlands borders the waking world, one cannot simply walk between them. I once possessed a key to the Gate of Dreams, but I lost it years ago and have been unable to find it since,” he laments."

"為了阻止夢境世界與清醒世界之間的融合，你決定強行以肉身進入“幻夢境”——你的新夥伴倫道夫是那樣稱呼那個世界的——而不是以睡眠狀態進入。“以這種方式進入幻夢境會面臨許多危險，但我想總好過另一種方式。”倫道夫說道，“如果我們以睡眠狀態進入，我們可能會像你的同伴們一樣被困住，無法醒來。”你贊同他所說的：如果被困在那頭，你幾乎做不了什麼，更加無法幫助仍在夢中的同伴。\n"
"“我們首先要找到一把鑰匙。就算能找到幻夢境與清醒世界之間的邊界，那也不是隨便就能穿越的地方。我曾經有睡夢之門的鑰匙，但在很多年前已經不見了，至今也找不回來。”他惋惜地說道。"

"The black cat, perched on a nearby park bench, glares at Randolph with narrow, disdainful eyes. “You lost the key to the Dreamlands?”\n"
"You share in the cat’s skepticism. Randolph sighs and shakes his head. “Let me explain,” he says to you. “It is not a physical key. It never was. The ‘key’ was the sense of wonder, fantasy, and creativity that sparked my imagination when I was young. These are things we do not value in maturity. It is only natural the key to these kinds of dreams should be lost with age.”\n"
"“What foolishness!” the black cat scolds. “It is not ‘maturity’ to leave one’s imagination behind. You have abandoned the best part of you. You are more a mewling kitten now than any child I have ever met.”\n"
"“Perhaps you are right,” Randolph agrees, downcast. “I forced myself to believe that earthly concerns were more important than juvenile fantasies of gilded spires, perfumed jungles, and twilight realms…and now I fear I shall never see such wonders again.” He turns back toward you, his eyes full of regret. “And worse, I will be unable to guide you."

"黑貓坐在不遠處公園的長凳上，眯起眼睛輕蔑地瞪著倫道夫：“你把通往幻夢境的鑰匙弄丢了？”\n"
"你和那隻黑貓一樣懷疑他說的話。倫道夫嘆氣，搖搖頭說道：“聽我解釋。”他對你說，“那不是一把真的鑰匙。從來就不是。那把‘鑰匙’是激發我小時候想象力的好奇、幻想，以及創造力。這都是我們變得成熟之後不再重視的。隨著年齡的增長，這些夢境的鑰匙便會自然消失。\n"
"“太蠢了！”黑貓罵道，“丟掉自己的想象力不等於‘成熟’。是你自己拋棄了你最寶貴的東西。比起我見過的任何一個人類小孩，現在的你都更像是一隻只會喵喵叫的小貓咪。”\n"
"“或許你說的沒錯。”倫道夫沮喪地認同黑貓的批評，“我逼自己去相信，現實的樁樁件件，都比年少時的幻想更重要，比如鍍金的尖塔、香氣馥郁的叢林、朦朧的國度……如今，恐怕我再也無法見到這些奇景了。”他回頭看著你，眼中滿是後悔，“更糟的是，我不能再給你引路了。”"

"你像以往調查失物事件一樣詢問：“你最後一次看到它是什麼時候？”“你最後一次使用它是什麼時候？”之類的問題。\n"

"You ask what might have turned Randolph’s mind away from the fantastical and toward more practical concerns. He thinks for a brief time, mulling over the possibilities. Then, his eyes go wide as he realizes something important. “There was an incident many years ago. It was the last time I was involved with something supernatural—that is, before today,” he explains. “I met a friend of mine—Joel Manton— in the graveyard next to the old abandoned house in the Merchant District. The one they call the <i>Unnamable</i>. I didn’t want to believe that it was truly haunted, as the stories told, but in merely repeating the legend, I drew the creature’s ire.”\n"
"You ask of the creature, and Randolph closes his eyes as a violent shudder courses up his spine. “It cannot be described. All I know is that we barely survived. It was my fault Joel was hurt. From that day forth, I have had no desire to delve into the supernatural or the superstitious. Not because I did not believe, but because I was frightened. Is that why the key eludes me? Is that why I can no longer dream?” The realization hits him, clear as day. “I know where we have to go. That is where I lost the key. That must be where it can be regained!” he exclaims, wide-eyed.\n"
"As Randolph frantically tries to hail a taxicab, you realize where he means to go: to the house without a name, where the indescribable creature that still haunts his memory resides…"

"你問倫道夫，他的思維是因為什麼而遠離幻想，轉移到現實上。他想了一會，仔細考慮可能的原因。然後，他突然想到了一些重要的事情，睜大了眼睛。“幾年前我發生過一件事。那是我最後一次跟超自然之類的扯上關係——今天這次除外。”他解釋道，“我在商人區那間老廢屋旁邊的墓地，與我的朋友喬爾·曼頓見面。人們都說那是一間‘無名鬼屋’。我並不相信那裡真的鬧鬼，所以我就照著鬼故事裡寫的做了一遍，結果卻激怒了它。”\n"
"你問‘它’是什麼，倫道夫閉上眼睛，一股猛烈的顫慄跑上了他的脊柱。“我無法描述。我只知道我們勉強撿回了小命。喬爾受了傷，這都是我的錯。在那天之後，我再也不想捲入超自然或者迷信的事情中。不是因為我不相信鬼神之說，而是因為我害怕。因此我失去了鑰匙？因此我再也無法入夢？”他清楚地意識到了這一點，“我知道我們該去哪。我們要去我失去鑰匙的地方。我一定可以在那裡找回鑰匙！”他瞪大了眼睛大聲說道。\n"
"當倫道夫發狂似地叫出租車時，你才意識到他要去的地方是那間無名鬼屋，那裡有著一個至今仍縈繞在他記憶中的難以名狀的怪物……"

"This place is nothing like the mystical forests, charming medieval villages, and majestic panoramas of which Virgil Gray wrote in his stories. No, far from it: this cold, bleak gulf eats away your hope and replaces it with a feeling of empty, meaningless dread. You ask Randolph if this is the way to your comatose companions. You almost hope that you are traveling in the wrong direction, so you can leave this awful place behind.\n"
"“I do not know,” he replies, peering out one of the windows along the stairway. “We have traveled beyond the waking world, but this is the lower plane of the Dreamlands, known as the Underworld. It is an inhospitable place. Many of the creatures we have seen crossing over into our world come from this region. Perhaps our key knew this was our true destination?” Your guide examines the arcane key you found in the abandoned house, running his fingers over its arabesques as though recalling its shape, its weight, its texture. His eyes water with the depth of his loss.\n"
"You offer to hold the key for him, which yanks him from his private thoughts. “Ah. Yes, perhaps that would be best,” he says, handing the delicate artifact to you. It is surprisingly heavy for something that, according to Randolph, is not real.\n"
"With Randolph and the Silver Key in tow, you continue your descent anew. The Underworld may or may not be where your companions are, but if the creatures invading the world of the waking are indeed from this place, then perhaps here you can find answers."

"這個地方完全不像維吉爾·格雷筆下的神祕森林、迷人的中世紀村莊和宏偉景觀。甚至與之大相徑庭：這片寒冷、荒涼的海灣吞噬了你的希望，取而代之的是空虛且毫無意義的恐懼。你問倫道夫，這是找到你昏迷的同伴們的道路嗎？你滿心希望你只是走錯了方向，那樣你就能離開這個可怕的地方。\n"
"“我不知道。”他一邊盯著樓梯邊上的一扇窗戶外面，一邊回答，“我們已經來到了清醒世界以外，但這裡是幻夢境的下層，名叫地下世界。這裡十分荒涼。之前我們看到的，進入我們世界的許多怪物，都來自這裡。或許我們的鑰匙知道這裡是我們真正的目的地？”你的嚮導仔細檢查你們在廢屋裡找到的神秘鑰匙，他的手指在鑰匙上阿拉伯式花紋上滑過，彷彿在回想它的形狀、重量和材質。他深深沉浸在悔恨的思緒中，雙眼含淚。\n"
"你提出幫他保管鑰匙，把他從自己的思緒裡抽離出來。“啊。好的，或許這麼做最好。”他說著，把那件精緻的造物交給了你。根據倫道夫所說，它並不是真實的鑰匙，但它卻出奇的沉重。\n"
"你與倫道夫一起，帶著銀鑰匙繼續旅程。你的同伴們或許就在地下世界，也可能不在，但如果入侵清醒世界的怪物確實來自此處，那麼也許你能從這裡找到答案。"

msgid "Your last waking sensation is the rush of noxious, frigid air as you are knocked to the ground by the thrashing, monolithic abomination with no name. The wind is pulled out of your lungs. You cannot scream. You grasp desperately at the ground as the creature tears at your skin and tramples your bones. Somehow you wrench yourself free, escaping through the vortex of bitter, withering wind surrounding the creature. You hear the scrape of peeling plaster. Debris whips past your head. A loose brick hits your shoulder. You wonder if there will even be a building left to tremble at when this is all over."

"You barely hear Randolph shouting to you over the maelstrom of ice-cold air that surrounds you. Despite all odds, you somehow reach him, the indescribable monstrosity hot on your heels. Randolph wrenches open your hand, grabs the key you found in the unnamed house, and clutches it tightly. He closes his eyes and whispers something inaudible. As the abominable torrent crashes into you, everything goes black.\n"
"When you awaken, you lie on a flat stone platform overlooking a steep, straight staircase that descends into unknown depths. Behind you, the stairway curls upward into a stone spire that ascends into a hazy mist. In both directions, the entirety of the cavern is dimly lit with grey phosphorescence. Randolph pulls you to your feet. “That was a close one,” he admits. “I never wish to take a journey like that again.” You ask where you are, and he bites his lip, looking out over the bleak, desolate scenery.\n"
"“This is the lower plane of the Dreamlands, known as the Underworld. It is an inhospitable place. Many of the creatures we have seen crossing over into our world come from this region. Perhaps our key knew this was our true destination. I think…I think it is gone now,” your guide explains.\n"
"You are thunderstruck. Randolph grits his teeth at your reaction and looks away in shame. “Forget it. We no longer need it anyway. Let’s go.” His curt reply echoes off the stone steps.

"In the debris, you spot it: something glinting within the maelstrom of ice-cold air and dust, something that calls to you, whispers your name. You barely hear Randolph shouting as the indescribable monstrosity crashes into him. Despite all odds, you somehow reach the rubble that was once the attic of the house with no name. You realize now what that elusive glimmer was: the polished reflection of a bright silver key. “Use it!” Randolph screams between cries of agony. The abomination climbs atop his body. “Use it now, while you ca—”\n"
"The thing cuts Randolph’s cry short as it envelops his body. You clutch the key tightly in your hand and shudder as you watch a thousand shapes of horror devour Randolph whole. You think of your companions, trapped somewhere in a perilous dream far from home, and the key’s glow intensifies, swallowing you as completely as the creature swallowed Randolph. Everything goes white.\n"

"It is clear you are no longer in the waking world. Perhaps the key transported your physical body into the Dreamlands, as Randolph claimed it could. But this place is nothing like the mystical forests, charming medieval villages, and majestic panoramas of which Virgil Gray wrote in his stories. No, far from it: this cold, bleak gulf eats away your hope and replaces it with a feeling of empty, meaningless dread. You peer once more up the countless steps behind you. It seems you have no choice now but to move on, deeper into this desolate and perilous realm."

"在無數碎片中，你發現有某物在寒冷氣流與沙塵形成的漩渦中閃爍著光芒，它正在呼喚著你，低聲唸著你的名字。那頭難以名狀的怪物撞向倫道夫時，你幾乎聽不見他的喊叫。你不知怎的越過了這重重異像，來到曾經是無名鬼屋閣樓的一堆碎石前。你終於明白那抹難以捕捉的微光究竟是什麼：那是一把明亮的銀鑰匙的反光。“用它！”倫道夫大喊著，近乎是痛苦的尖叫。那頭異形巨怪爬在他身上。“快用那把鑰匙，不然——”\n"
"那傢伙包裹住倫道夫的身體，扼止了他的尖叫。你緊緊握著那把鑰匙，顫抖著看著倫道夫被擁有萬千形態的駭物完全吞噬。你想到被困在危險夢境之中、遠離家鄉的同伴，此時鑰匙光芒驟然增強，將你整個人都吞沒其中，就像那頭怪物吞噬倫道夫一樣。眼前只剩無際的白色。\n"
