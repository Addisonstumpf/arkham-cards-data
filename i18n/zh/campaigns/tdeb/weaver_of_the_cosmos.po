msgstr "冒險IV-B"

msgid "Everything has led to this. Virgil's writing, your companions' never-ending sleep, St. Mary's, the black cat, all of it. You have no choice but to press on. This transdimensional space is home to a creature that would obliterate your world and replace it with a new reality, a nightmarescape of pitch-black darkness and creatures that prey on your kind. If you cannot stop its weaving, there will be no Earth left to wake up to. You have to do something, even if it means your end."
msgstr "所有的一切都指向這裡。維吉爾的作品，你同伴的永眠症狀，聖瑪麗醫院，黑貓，所有這一切。你別無選擇，只得前進。這個跨維度的空間住著一個生物。它會摧毀你的世界，並且編織出一個嶄新的現實世界——漆黑的噩夢，來替換掉你原來的世界，人類會成為怪物的獵物。如果你無法阻止它的編織，那麼你們的地球家園將不復存在，甦醒也再無任何意義。你必須做些什麼，哪怕這會賠上你的性命。"

msgstr "蛛后"

msgid "You climb a precipice of stone and behold the enormity of the spider's bridge and the <i>thing</i> astride it: Atlach-Nacha, god of spiders, accompanied by its horde of weavers. The many-legged monstrosities continuously intertwine strands of cosmic web, toiling endlessly with nightmarish fervor. As the awful creatures weave each thread, you feel reality and dreams distort, collide, and crash together. In the distance, waves of dream break upon the rocks of reality, and reality collapses upon itself into the surging, amorphous dream. You can barely comprehend the strange, shifting vistas. A sticky web hangs off the side of your vantage point, like a silken ladder leading down to your doom."
msgstr "你爬上了懸崖石壁，看到了蜘蛛築造的巨大網橋，也看到了橋上的蜘蛛之神阿特拉克·納克亞，還有它的織網者大軍。這些多腿的可怕怪物不斷編織著宇宙之網，像是被噩夢般的狂熱驅動著不停勞作。它們每織上一根蛛絲，你都能感覺到現實與夢境的扭曲和相撞。在遠處，夢像波浪一樣拍在現實的岩石上，而現實岩石也自動崩塌，化作洶湧而無序的睡夢。你幾乎無法理解這一幕怪異的變幻場景。你能看到一張黏糊糊的蛛網懸掛在你所處平臺的邊緣，就像一條絲狀的梯子，通向你的死亡。"

"You are about to climb down the web to the platform below, when you hear the black cat's voice from behind your companion, Randolph. \"Drop it,\" the voice commands. A sinister grin spreads across Randolph's face as he drops a jagged onyx blade, which clatters to the ground.\n"
"\"So you have seen through my mask?\" he says. \"No matter. You will complete the errand upon which I have sent you, regardless. Your world depends on it.\"\n"
"Bewildered, you ask why Randolph is acting this way. The black cat jumps onto your shoulder and perches there, its gaze never leaving your erstwhile companion. \"I figured it out a little while ago. He's not Randolph. He never was. Just an interloper in Randolph's skin.\"\n"
"\"Interloper?\" Randolph thunders with anger. \"You, cat, are the interloper! Yes, I know what you are. This is not your place. But enough talk.\" A smile crawls along his lips once more. \"You have a task to perform. Goodbye, then… for now.\" With his warning complete, Not-Randolph walks off of the edge of the platform and falls into oblivion."
msgstr ""
"你正要爬下蛛網，到下方的平臺去，這時你聽見你的同伴倫道夫背後響起了黑貓的聲音：“扔了它。”聲音命令道。倫道夫臉上露出一抹邪惡的笑容，同時將一把帶有鋸齒的縞瑪瑙尖刀扔在地上。\n"
"“你看穿了我的偽裝？”他問道，“無所謂。反正，你們怎樣都會完成我指派的任務。畢竟這關係到你們世界的存亡。”\n"
"你不解地問它倫道夫為什麼會這樣做。黑貓跳上你的肩膀，目光一刻不離你曾經的同伴。“我剛剛才發現，他不是倫道夫。從來就不是。它只是披著倫道夫皮囊的入侵者。”\n"
"“入侵者？”倫道夫怒道，“你這隻貓才是入侵者！沒錯，我知道你是誰。你不該在這裡。我們廢話少說。”他嘴角又一次浮現了那邪惡的微笑，“畢竟你們還有要事在身。我們就此別過……後會有期。”說完之後，那位不是倫道夫的男子走下平臺，墜入虛空消失不見。"

"You begin to climb down the web to the platform below, from which you can reach the edge of the bridge and Atlach-Nacha itself. Halfway down, the suspended platform jolts and starts to sway violently from side to side. You grip the silken threads tightly, hoping that the sticky web will keep you from falling. You look to Randolph to make sure he is okay, and it is then that you notice he is not climbing above you as you had suspected he would. You look up to find your companion scowling at you from above, a blade of onyx in his hands. He has cut a segment of the web upon which you are climbing. You plummet to the rocks below, landing painfully on your back. When you look back up at Randolph, his countenance has changed.\n"
"\"Foolish mortals. I was never going to allow you to save your companions. You have an errand of mine to run, and that is your sole purpose. If you wish to live, complete this task for me.\" He peers across at the unfathomble spider that looms before you. \"I shall be the one to claim your world—not that thing.\" Then, Not-Randolph simply turns and walks away."

"“愚蠢的凡人。我從未打算讓你去救你的同伴。你得替我辦事，而這也是你唯一的用處。如果你想活命，就完成我的任務。”他凝視著赫然出現在你面前的怪異蜘蛛，“你的世界只會屬於我——而不屬於<b>那傢伙</b>。”然後，那個並非倫道夫的男子轉身離開。"

The void that once surrounded you fades into a dusky evening, and a familiar skyline of clustering gambrel roofs stands before you. To your dismay, the entirety of the town has been infested by the brood of Atlach-Nacha. Thick webbing extends from the gloomy streets to the tallest rooftops. Spiders and ghasts prowl through the city's once-busy avenues, seeking human prey to devour—or worse, to imprison forever in cocoons of unbreakable web. You drop to your knees, overtaken by despiar. How far does this corruption reach? Is it just Arkham, or…?"
msgstr "兩個世界之間的虛空一片漆黑，佈滿蛛網，黏答答的，你在這裡掙扎了好幾個小時。當你來到巨網形成的橋樑末端，你看到了可怕的景象。曾經包圍著你的虛空變成了黯淡的夜空，天際線是你熟悉的斜屋頂。你驚愕地發現整座小城都佈滿了阿特拉克·納克亞的子嗣。從陰鬱的大街小巷，到高聳的屋頂，到處都是厚重的蛛網。蜘蛛與噩妖在城中曾經繁華的街道上遊蕩，尋找人類獵物，吞噬他們——或者更糟，把他們永遠囚禁在牢不可破的網繭之中。絕望的情緒讓你崩潰，你不由跪倒在地。這慘劇會演變成什麼樣？只有阿卡姆淪陷了嗎？還是說……"

msgid "In the distance, you can see the tower that loomed behind the spider god as it spun its web, the entrance beckoning you closer. You recall the Tower of Koth in the Underworld and the way to the surface. Is this the root of that same tower? Does it penetrate through this world-between-worlds? If so, you might be able to escape. Instead of climbing back the way you came, you swing your web from side to side and make a leap through the void, landing at the base of the tower. Then you begin the long climb up—above the surface of the Sea of Pitch, under the ground below the City of Gugs, then farther upward still. Finally, after miles and miles of restless travel, you push aside the stone slab at the top of the tower, and you emerge in the Enchanted Wood. You seal the entrance behind you. Nothing from the hellish Underworld can follow you here. For the first time since entering the Dreamlands, you breathe a sigh of relief. Recalling the first chapter's of Virgil Gray's story, you follow a narrow path through the woods until you reach a staircase of solid stone that ascends into the clouds. It is time to return home."
msgstr "你遠遠望去，可以看到蜘蛛之神後面若隱若現的高塔，塔的入口誘惑著你，趁著蜘蛛之神正在織網時過去。你回想起來地下世界的卡斯之塔，以及通往地面的道路。這是那座塔的底部嗎？它是否穿透了這片位於兩個世界之間的空間？如果真是如此，或許你能夠藉此逃離。你不再像來時一樣原路攀爬返回，而是藉助蛛網前後擺盪，騰空跳躍，落到那座高塔的底部。然後，你開始向上漫長的攀登——浮出漆黑之海的海面，進入古革巨人之城的地下，再繼續向上攀登。最後，經過不眠不休的漫長攀登，你推開了塔頂的石板門，回到了魔幻森林。你封印了入口，繼續前行。不能讓那地獄般的地下世界裡的怪物跟你到這裡來。自從進入幻夢境以來，你終於第一次舒了一口氣。你回憶著維吉爾·格雷的故事開頭，沿著一條狹窄的小徑穿過森林，來到一條高聳入雲的石質樓梯前。是時候回家了。"

msgid "You have stopped the spider god from completing its web, but in the process, you have cut off your only means of escape as well. You are fated to wander this hellish world-between-worlds, searching in vain for any hope of escape. Your only solace is that you have prevented this cruel future from being that of every person on Earth. Perhaps if you still possessed the Silver Key, you might have had a way out. Try as you might, in this dismal, cavernous void below the bottomless Sea of Pitch, you cannot muster the will to forge your own."
msgstr "你阻止了蜘蛛之神完成它的蛛網橋樑，但在這過程中，你也斬斷了自己唯一的退路。你找不到逃離的一絲希望，註定要遊蕩在這地獄般的異界之間。唯一能安慰你的，是你阻止了如此殘酷的命運落在地球每一個人的身上。要是你還有銀鑰匙，說不定還能逃出這裡。在深不可測的漆黑之海下方，這片沉悶而寬廣的虛空之中，你用盡一切努力，始終無法振奮精神來打造自己的銀鑰匙。"

msgstr "結局5"

msgid "You have stopped the spider god from completing its web, but in the process, you have cut off the quickest way for you to return home. So, with your task complete, you begin the long climb towards reality. You are lucky that remnants of the web-bridge still remain intact, or you would have been stranded in this hellish world between worlds. It takes many hours for you to retrace your steps to the Underworld. You eventually emerge from the thick, tar-like Sea of Pitch, close to the shoreline. To your dismay, you realize that you are on the opposite shore of the sea from the dark vale from which you once embarked. With no way to cross the deadly sea, you'll have to find another way out of this barren expanse. Days pass as you continue to explore the Underworld, reaching darker and more forbidden lands as you travel deeper and deeper below the crust of the Earth's Dreamlands. Though you eventually find a stairway up, it is very different from the one leading to the Unnamable: a spiraling otherworldy series of steps that reach dizzying heights and break all laws of reality. When you reach the top, your heart sinks. There is no sign of Arkham here. You are greeted instead by a strange, ruined city and its half-human denizens. The creatures inform you that you have reached the lost city of \"Sarkomand.\" It appears your return journey is far from over."
msgstr "你阻止了蜘蛛之神完成它的蛛網橋樑，但在這過程中，你也斬斷了自己重返家園的最快路徑。於是，你完成自己的任務之後，開始了通往現實世界的漫長攀登。還好那座蛛網橋樑殘餘的部分仍然能用，不然你就永遠被困在這地獄般的異界之間了。你花了無數小時，終於回到地下世界。你從漆黑之海那稠如瀝青的水體浮出，接近海岸。讓你感到沮喪的是，你意識到你所在的海岸與你乘船啟航時的那片黑暗山谷隔海相望。你無法穿越這片危險的海域，必須另尋出路，好離開這片寬闊無邊的荒涼之地。你又花了些日子繼續探索地下世界，在幻夢境地殼以下越走越深，來到了更為黑暗、更不應進入的地方。雖然最後你找到了一條向上的樓梯，但這與通向無名小屋的那條樓梯截然不同：眼前的樓梯呈螺旋形，神秘的一級級臺階向上延伸，直至令人暈眩的高度，打破了現實世界的一切法則。你走到樓梯頂上時，心不禁往下一沉。迎接你的不是熟悉的阿卡姆，而是一座破敗的古怪城市及其半人形的居民。這些生物告訴你，你來到了一座名叫“薩科曼德”的失落城市。看來你的歸途遠未結束。"
