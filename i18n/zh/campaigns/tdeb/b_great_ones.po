"A cat’s low-pitched wail draws your attention to a nearby web. When you arrive, you find the black cat stuck on a patch of particularly sticky web, wriggling back and forth in a vain attempt to free itself. Even with its sharp claws, it seems to be in trouble. You lean over and pull the cat free, and it leaps from your arms to a rocky platform below, the only thing between the cat and an endless void. It hisses for a moment, then stands tall. “Did I ask for your help?” it scolds. “Well, you made it below the Sea of Pitch after all. Now look around you. See all this webbing?” You couldn’t miss it even if you tried; you are surrounded on all sides by webs, treacherous pathways across the aether. “It is a bridge between your world and the Dreamlands. If it is completed, the two will merge. Understand? Unless you want everything to look like that hospital where your friends are sleeping, you have to stop this at all costs. Nothing else matters. <i>Nothing.</i>”"

"一聲低沉的貓叫聲吸引你望向附近的一張網。你走近時，你發現黑貓被粘在一張黏糊糊的蛛網上，它極力掙扎，卻無法掙脫。即使有著鋒利的爪子，它似乎也遇上了麻煩。你俯下身，把貓抱了出來，它跳出了你的懷抱，落到下面的一個岩石平臺上，那是黑貓與虛空之間唯一存在的東西。它低聲咆哮片刻，然後挺直身軀。“我說過要你幫忙了嗎？”它罵道，“好吧，你還是來到了漆黑之海底下。看看你周圍吧。看到這些網了嗎？”即使你不去看，你也無法無視周圍的蜘蛛網，它們圍成一條通往虛空的險路。“這是你的世界與幻夢境之間的橋樑。如果這條橋樑搭成，兩個世界就會融合。明白了嗎？如果你不想讓整個世界變成那所醫院——你昏睡的朋友們所在的醫院——你就必須不惜一切代價來阻止此事。沒有任何事比這重要。<b>沒有</b>。”"

msgid "“Hey, you still have that key?” the black cat asks. You scrounge through your belongings for the key you found in the Unnamable and show it to the cat. “Gimme that,” it demands, jumping and biting it out of your hands before you can protest. “Don’t look at me like that. Your other friends need it more than you.”"
msgstr "“嘿，那把鑰匙還在你這兒嗎？”黑貓問道。你在行囊裡翻找一通，把你從無名小屋裡找到的鑰匙拿給黑貓看。“給我。”它提出要求，並且在你還沒來得及抗議之前就跳了起來，把鑰匙從你手中叼走，“別這樣看著我。你的朋友們比你更需要這個。”"

"The black cat stops talking as it spots Randolph for the first time. It circles around the man a few times, agitated. For his part, Randolph looks uncharacteristically perturbed by the cat’s presence, even taking a step backward as it closes in. “What is the matter? I’ve not harmed any of your kind,” he says matter-of-factly. “Have I done something to offend you?”\n"
"“Your mere existence offends me,” the cat replies with a hiss. It strolls back toward you, keeping a wary eye on Randolph. “I think I know what is going on now. It all makes sense. I know who is interfering with my sight. Do not trust that <i>thing</i>,” it warns, circling to keep an eye on the blond man behind it. “I have to prepare. I’ll return when the time is right.”"

"黑貓一看到倫道夫就立刻安靜了下來。它不安地圍繞著這個人類男子轉了一圈又一圈。至於倫道夫，他看起來對於貓的出現感到異常緊張，甚至在它靠近時退後了腳步。“有什麼事嗎？我沒有傷害過你的同胞。”他坦率地說道，“我做了什麼冒犯你的事情嗎？”\n"
"“你光是存在就冒犯了我。”黑貓咆哮著回應。它慢慢回到你身邊，警惕地盯著倫道夫。“我知道這是怎麼回事了。一切都說通了。我知道是誰在干擾我，影響我預見了。別相信那傢伙。”它警告道，並且來回踱步，盯著身後的那個金髮男子，“我得作好準備。等時機到來，我會回來的。”"

msgid "“…the being they face is one with thousands, perhaps an endless number of masks. <smallcaps>Nyarlathotep</smallcaps>, it is called by some. It is manipulative, deceptive, and cunning. It is probably the thing that trapped them in the Dreamlands to begin with. Why, I have no idea. If you want them to survive, they’re probably going to need my help. You’ll be okay here on your own, right?” The black cat doesn’t wait for an answer; without another word, it leaps into the aether below and vanishes."
msgstr "“……那傢伙有著數以千計，甚至可能是無窮的假面。有的人稱它為<b>奈亞拉托提普</b>。它擅長操控和欺騙他人，詭計多端。你的朋友們一開始被困在幻夢境，或許就是它的傑作。你要問為什麼，我也不知道。如果你希望你的朋友們活命，或許該讓我去幫幫他們。你自己待在這兒會沒事的，對吧？”黑貓不等你回答，便話也不說地跳進了下方的虛空，消失了蹤影。"

msgid "“…that bridge I just mentioned? The creature weaving it is unlike anything you have ever seen. <smallcaps>Atlach-Nacha</smallcaps> is the name I have heard whispered in the dark corners of the Dreamlands. It is the master and progenitor of all the spiders crawling around these parts. Maybe all parts, really. You’re going to need my help to stop its scheme.”"
msgstr "“……還記得我剛剛提的那道橋樑嗎？編織那張網的生物是你前所未見的。我曾經在幻夢境的黑暗角落裡聽到過它的名諱：<b>阿特拉克·納克亞</b>。它是這裡爬行的所有蜘蛛的主人，也是它們的祖先。或許不止這裡，而是世上所有的。要想阻止它的陰謀，你會需要我幫忙的。”"
