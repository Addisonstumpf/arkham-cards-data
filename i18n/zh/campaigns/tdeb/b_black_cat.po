"“…You must be their friends,” the enigmatic voice says from above. To your surprise, the quiet voice belongs not to a person, but to a black cat that lounges lazily across a tree branch hanging over the path outside the hospital. “Oh, pick your jaws up off the ground and listen.” The cat rises and leaps onto the top of a nearby fence, walking along it with the kind of grace only cats possess.\n"
"“It is one of the cats of Earth’s Dreamlands,” Randolph proclaims, his voice tinged with merriment, like he was meeting an old friend for the first time in ages. “How long it has been since I have spoken with one of your kind!”\n"
"The cat’s piercing yellow eyes glare at Randolph for a moment before it returns its gaze to you. “…Sure. In any event, I bear a message from your dreaming friends.”"

"“……你一定就是他們的朋友了。”上方傳來那道謎一般的聲音。令你驚訝的是，這安靜的聲音並不屬於人類，而屬於一隻黑貓，它正在醫院外面路旁的樹枝上懶洋洋地躺著。“噢，把你的下巴從地上撿起來，聽我說。”貓站了起來，跳到附近的樹籬頂上，以貓咪獨有的優雅姿態沿著樹籬行走。\n"
"“它來自地球的幻夢境。”倫道夫說明道，他的聲音裡帶著幾分歡悅，像是重遇了多年不見的故交，“我好久沒和你們說上話了！”\n"
"那隻貓敏銳的黃色眼睛盯著倫道夫片刻，隨後將目光轉回你身上。“……是啊。不過，我是給你那幾位睡夢中的朋友們帶口信的。”"

msgid "“Your friends are not the only ones in trouble,” the black cat explains. “There’s a grand conspiracy at work here, and your friends are…well, let’s just say they’re a bit preoccupied with their own problems at the moment. You’re the only ones who can destroy the great web. Forget about your companions and descend into the pitch. It’s the only way. I’ll try to keep your friends safe while you fulfill your task. Do you understand?”"
msgstr "“遇上麻煩的不只是你的朋友。”黑貓解釋道，“這裡醞釀著一個巨大的陰謀，而你的朋友們……唔，我只能說他們現在把全部精力都用在應對自己的難題上了。只有你能打破巨網。忘記同伴，親自上場吧。除此之外，別無他法。在你完成你的任務之前，我會盡力保護你的朋友們。你聽明白了嗎？”"

My pet human, Virgil, is one of them. Yes, that Virgil. I see the looks on your faces. They’re also with another dreamer, a man named…hey, wait a minute.” The cat glares suspiciously at Randolph, then yawns. “Huh. You know what? Never mind. I have to check on something.” With that, the cat suddenly departs."
msgstr "黑貓告訴你關於幻夢境的一切，以及你的朋友們即將展開的探索。“你的朋友們在幻夢境裡一處安全的地方，跟他們一起的還有另外兩個人。其中包括我的寵物維吉爾。我看穿你臉上的表情了，沒錯，就是那個維吉爾。還有一個入夢者，名叫……啊，慢著。”貓懷疑地盯著倫道夫，然後打了個哈欠，“哈。沒什麼，別在意。我得確認一些事情。”說完之後，那隻貓突然消失了。"

msgid "“So, your pals aren’t looking too good. They wanted me to tell you that they’re in a lot of trouble. They can’t wake up until they fulfill this quest, and it’s not going to be easy. The eye of chaos is watching them. You’ve got your work cut out for you, but you also might be their only hope.” The black cat hops down from the fence and starts to walk away. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’d better get back to your friends before they all get themselves killed.”"
msgstr "“所以，你的朋友他們遇上了大麻煩。他們必須完成這次探索，否則就無法醒來，而他們要做的事情絕不輕鬆。混沌之眼正盯著他們。確實你也有很多事要做，但你可能是他們唯一的希望了。”黑貓跳下籬笆，轉身欲離開，“那麼，恕我告退，我得趕在你朋友們把自己害死之前回去呢。”"

msgid "“Your friends told me to tell you that they’re fine. In fact, they told me to warn you that you’re the ones in real danger. I’d believe them if I were you. There’s a grand conspiracy at work here, and you’re the only ones who can stop it. The best thing you can do is forge onward, for both your sakes. Don’t worry, I’ll stick around for a while. Someone’s gotta keep you alive.”"

msgid "“Nah, you know what? Forget about it. I’m sure you’ll be fine.” The black cat suddenly leaves without another word."
msgstr "“算了，沒什麼，不用在意。我相信你們自己搞得定。”黑貓突然就走了，什麼都沒再說。"
