"Passing through the gate is unlike anything you’ve ever experienced. You feel your body twisting and distorting, churning through realities as the gate pulls you to its ultimate destination—a place beyond the scope of human imagination.\n"
"Suddenly, all is quiet and the chaos of the journey is replaced with a sense of solitude and dread. You are in an unfathomable place, vast beyond your ability to reason and utterly alien besides. The landscape is surreal and strange, the architecture impossible. You are so far from home that home has become a threadbare dream you can barely recall. Even should you find a way out of this awful place, you may never be the same again."

"穿越傳送門後，你見到了人生中前所未見的世界。你感到自己的身體不斷扭曲，強大的漩渦將你帶到了一個遙遠的境地，這是遠遠超越人類想像力極限的空間。\n"
"旅途的疲勞令你感到耳鳴，周圍的環境異常安靜，令耳鳴聲變得更加尖銳。待你緩過神來，你向四周看去，這裡的景象超越你的理解範圍，甚至不屬於任何一顆星球的表面景象。這裡的景象超乎現實，詭異至極，建築外觀極其不合理。你離開家鄉實在太遠，家鄉成了你幾乎記不起的一個舊夢。即使你能夠離開這個鬼地方，你也不再是從前的你了。"

"When put into play, a single‐sided location is put into play with its revealed side faceup, because it has no unrevealed side. Otherwise, it functions as a normal location in every other way."

msgid "Where did you come from? Why are you here? Are you dreaming, or is this place real? Now that you think about it, haven’t you been here before? Or perhaps you’ve been here all along. Now you remember. This is your real home. The path you now walk is but one ledge, with many more below. You only have to fall and you will be where you belong. One more step…"
msgstr "你從哪裡來？要往哪裡去？你是在夢中，還是在現實？你是第一次來到這兒，還是曾經來過？你慢慢思考著，終於想起，這裡才是你的家。你往前走著，終於來到台階的盡頭，面前是無窮盡的深淵。現在，只要再往前走一步，你就到家了……"

msgid "Lying on your back in a patch of wet grass, you find yourself staring longingly at the night sky. Somehow, you are once again atop Sentinel Hill, unable to recall exactly how you got here. You are mesmerized by the night sky. Seconds become minutes, and minutes become hours. Eventually, you are found and lifted to your feet by a group of Dunwich citizens. “What happened? What are ya doin’ here?” they ask you, frightened but curious. You can’t seem to find the right words to describe the events that occurred beyond the gate…if they ever truly occurred. There doesn’t appear to be any trace of Seth Bishop, of the creatures you fought earlier, or of the phantasmal and otherworldly gate. But every time you sleep, you dream—and when you dream, it all comes rushing back."
msgstr "你躺在潮濕的草地上，發現自己正呆滯地凝望著夜空的群星。不知道為什麼，你又回到了哨兵峰，你已經記不起是如何到達這兒的。你被這夜色迷住了，你看著星空，任憑時間如水般流逝。直到一群敦威治村民走上山頭，把你給圍住，問道：“怎麼回事？你在這兒做甚麼呢？”他們的聲音裡，充滿著驚恐和好奇。你想要說點什麼，卻發現自己詞窮了。原來世間一切的詞彙，都無法描述那個時空外領域的景色。你想了想，就算告訴他們，應該也不會有人相信。賽斯·畢曉普早已不見蹤影，山上的怪物也消失不見，也許他們永遠困在了異界之中。每當你入睡，你就會做夢——夢中一切又都回來了。"

"Several of the villagers from Dunwich heard the ruckus on Sentinel Hill and went to investigate. What they found there answered none of their questions.\n"
"“What d’you think happened?” a frightened Curtis Whateley asks as they examine the hilltop. The other villagers shake their heads, unable to say. “Last thing I saw, the sky’d open’d up an’ there was a bright flash,” one of them says, looking up at the starry sky from the top of Sentinel Hill.\n"
"“Those Arkham fellas ain’t nowhere to be seen,” Curtis adds, looking down at the cracked stone altar. “Not even of a hint of ‘em. Mr. Bishop and his pals, now, that’s a diff’rent story.” The young man motions toward several corpses on the ground.\n"
"“Think we should get ahold of those coppers outta Aylesbury?”\n"
"“Why, so they can laugh at us again?” Curtis spits. “They ain’t never gonna believe us ‘bout all this anyway.” He glances at the stone altar, fidgeting nervously. “Better t’ forget about the whole thing. C’mon, let’s bury the dead and get outta here.”"

"哨兵山的喧鬧聲吸引來了敦威治的村民。但是面前的景象令他們大為不解。\n"
"“你，你們說，這到底是怎麼回事呢？”柯蒂斯·沃特雷畏畏縮縮地問道。其他的村民在檢查哨兵峰後，都不解地搖著頭。“我昨天看到了，天空突然打起雷，還出現一個巨大的洞。”一個村民說道，一邊抬頭，仰望著哨兵山上的天空。\n"
"“那些阿卡姆來的傢伙怎麼不見了？”柯蒂斯小心翼翼地查看破碎的祭壇。另一個年輕人指著另一處地面上的屍體，說道：“除了那些屍體，什麼東西都沒留下，連畢曉普先生都不見了。”\n"
"“要不然，把這些屍體扔到艾斯伯里山好了？”\n"
"“不要不要，不然那些人又要嘲笑我們了。”柯蒂斯反對道。“他們也不會相信我們的，這真是太荒唐了。”他朝祭壇看了一眼，身子還是有點發抖。“我們還是趕緊把這些屍體埋起來，忘了這一切吧。”"

msgid "The creature erupts in a cosmic fury of sound, color, and distorted space, hurling you back and away from it. You watch in horror as one of its arms tears through the fabric of the world, and its amorphous shape funnels through the rift, pulling the threads of the world along with it. You try to cling to something, but you are inexorably sucked into the rift. You feel as if your body is stretching and your mind is being crushed. Then, everything goes black."
msgstr "那怪物憤怒地朝著你咆嘯著，頓時，顏色、聲音和混亂的時間都一下子具象化，把你震得老遠。你驚恐地看著它的手臂撕裂了現世，而其形狀不定的身驅像是穿過漏斗一般，從狹縫中擠了出去，連同整個世界一同撼動。你試圖抓住什麼東西，但你還是被無情地吸入裂縫，感覺整個身體都被撕裂，神智崩潰，終於，你失去了意識。"

msgid "The sorcerers from Dunwich, seeking arcane power from beyond this realm, have accomplished what Wilbur and Old Whateley could not. Through blood sacrifice and indescribable experiments, the dark power the sorcerers sought is now within their reach. However, they will never get the chance to truly wield this power. In beseeching Wilbur’s father for knowledge, they have drawn the creature forth from its extradimensional realm. Yog-Sothoth emerges from the open rift above Sentinel Hill, blotting out the sky and enveloping the world. Now it has come to Earth, and it rules where humanity once tread."
msgstr "敦威治的法師們，窮極一生尋找著異界的魔力源泉，他們完成了威爾伯和老沃特雷沒能做到的事情。經過了鮮血獻祭和不可名狀的實驗，法師們掌握了他們所追尋的黑暗力量。但是，他們永遠都沒有機會去運用這股力量了。他們曾向威爾伯的父親索要知識，將這個生物從異界招來。猶格·索托斯從哨兵山上空開啟的裂縫出現，遮蔽蒼穹，壟罩整個世界。現在它已降臨到地球，統治人類曾經立足的世界。"
