msgstr "幕間故事II：倖存者"

msgid "Inside the chamber that contained the terrible beast, you find the missing townsfolk and the others from Arkham; they are bound and shackled. You also find several documents that suggest the creature you found isn’t the only one of its kind in Dunwich. You free the creature’s victims from their bonds, and they offer you their thanks. You begin to plan your next move."
msgstr "在關押著怪物的密室深處，你終於找到了敦威治和阿卡姆的失蹤者。他們手腳都被繩索捆住，嘴巴也被堵上了。你找到了一份文件，看來賽拉斯還不是敦威治唯一的怪物。你把那些受難者解放了出來，他們十分感謝你。現在，是時候計畫下一步行動了。"

msgid "“It is far worse than we had thought,” Dr. Armitage says, pale and trembling. “Wilbur Whateley was only the beginning. There were more, many more in Dunwich, who knew of the ‘Great Old Ones’ and who desired power and knowledge above all else, the Earth be damned. I knew I should have burned that wretch’s journal. But thanks to its contents, I know how we can stop them. We are the only ones who can! Now quickly, help me with this solution—the powder is the key, yes, the powder is the only way...”"
msgstr "“這比我想像的還要糟糕，”阿米蒂奇博士臉色蒼白，瑟瑟發抖，連聲音都在打顫，“威爾伯·沃特雷只是一切的開始。敦威治還有更多的人知道‘舊日支配者’，他們人數眾多，渴望凌駕一切的力量與知識，希望毀滅這個地球。我早就該把那個混蛋的日記給燒掉的。但多虧了他的日記，我也搞清楚了阻止他們的辦法。我們是最後的希望了！好了，快點行動起來，我們需要一種獨特的粉末，沒錯，有一種粉末可以幫我們的忙……”"

msgid "Professor Rice adjusts his glasses and studies the documents and arcane manuscripts left in the chamber. “I thought this nightmare was over and done with,” he sighs. “But we have a duty to see this through. We have to stop these creatures, or it won’t be just Dunwich in trouble. The powder mixture Armitage created to see the creatures will be our saving grace,” he explains, and sets off to the task of recreating the powder."
msgstr "萊斯教授擦了擦眼鏡，開始查看桌面上剩下來的文件。“我本來以為這段惡夢已經結束了，”他嘆息道，“但我們的使命尚未完成。我們必須要阻止這些怪物。否則，有麻煩的就不只是敦威治了。阿米蒂奇創造了一種粉末，能夠讓無法看見的怪物顯形。”他一邊解釋，一邊在桌上調配這種粉末。"

msgid "Professor Warren Rice survived The Dunwich Legacy."
msgstr "沃倫·萊斯教授在敦威治事件中存活。"

msgid "“Thank you for everything you’ve done,” Dr. Morgan says, taking count of your provisions and ammunition. “Last time, we needed some of that strange powder Armitage concocted to even see the beast that terrorized Dunwich. If there’s more of those things out there, we’re going to need that powder. I think I remember how he made it...”"
msgstr "“感謝你所做的一切，”摩爾根博士一邊說，一邊清點著你們剩餘的補給品。“之前，阿米蒂奇曾經提到過一種奇怪的粉末，可以讓敦威治的怪物顯形。如果事態繼續惡化下去，我們就不得不用上那個粉末了。我想我還能記得那個配方……”"

msgid "“Dunwich’s had its fair share of oddities,” Zebulon explains to you with a quavering voice, “but I ain’t ever seen anything as sick and twisted as this...this...<b>thing</b>.” He gives the creature’s remains one last sickened glance before closing the door to the chamber behind him, shuddering. He locks eyes with you, his expression grim. “Whoever dun this gotta pay. I’ll do all I can to help.”"
msgstr "“敦威治的怪事也不是一件兩件了，”西布倫想要努力裝作平靜，但發抖的聲音出賣了他，“但是我還從沒見過那麼噁心、扭曲的……<b>東西</b>。”他最後厭惡地看了一眼那個生物的屍體，顫抖著關上了身後的門。他眼睛凝視著你，表情嚴峻。“我現在一定要找那個混蛋算帳，放心吧，我會全力幫你的。”"

msgid "“I never could’a made it if it weren’t for you,” Earl says with a stammer, shaking your hand repeatedly. “If ’n there’s anything I can do to repay yeh, just ask away. I ain’t much of a fighter or anythin’, but I’ll do all I can. Jus’...don’t make me look at anythin’ like that beast again, a’right?”"
msgstr "“哎呀，如果不是你，我都不曉得死在哪兒了，”厄爾握著你的手拼命地搖。“你的大恩大德我無以為報，你有啥要求就儘管說。我雖然不太會打架，但是有甚麼事情我能幫就幫……就一點，請別讓我再看到那種<b>怪物</b>，行不？”"
