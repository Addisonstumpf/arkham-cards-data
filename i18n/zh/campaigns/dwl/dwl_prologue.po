"Dr. Henry Armitage pours himself a glass of pinot and sits down at his desk, gesturing for you to sit across from him. “I apologize for the short notice,” he begins. His face is pale, his forehead sweaty and wrinkled with worry.\n"
"Armitage—the head librarian of Miskatonic University, and a former mentor of yours—privately contacted you in the hopes of gaining your assistance. Eager to help, you made your way to his home in Southside. Upon entering, you were surprised to find his home in disarray. Books and notes litter his desk, and an empty bottle of wine has tipped over onto the ground by the fireplace. You’d always known Armitage to be neat and well-organized.\n"
"The elderly man takes a moment to collect his thoughts. “I am looking for two of my colleagues—Dr. Francis Morgan, professor of archaeology, and Warren Rice, professor of languages. Warren was supposed to meet up with me over supper earlier today to discuss several important findings, but he has since gone missing. At first I thought nothing of it, but I have a nagging feeling something else is going on. A very… <b>familiar</b> feeling.” You’ve never seen Armitage quite this worried before. His hands tremble as he reaches for the glass on his desk, and he sips from it nervously. “I tried to find Francis, hoping he knew where Warren was, but he too is out of touch. Francis has been spending a lot of time in some gambling den, or so I am told.\n"
"“I sent for you because I am worried Warren might be in trouble. I would appreciate it greatly if you could find him for me. You may also wish to ask Francis for help, if you can reach him.”"

"亨利·阿米蒂奇博士給自己倒了一杯白葡萄酒，然後坐在他的寫字桌前，向你招了招手，示意你坐下。“很抱歉，我這麼急著叫你出來。”他說道。你看了看他的臉色，一片蒼白，額頭上輕微出汗，眉頭緊鎖著。\n"
"阿米蒂奇是米斯卡塔尼克大學圖書館的負責人，也是你的前任導師。就在剛才，他急匆匆地給你打了一通電話，希望你能去一趟南區他的家中。你一進門，屋中的混亂程度出乎你的意料。他的寫字桌上堆滿了書和紙片，火爐旁邊擺著一個空酒瓶，這可不太像是阿米蒂奇的作風。\n"
"這個老人稍微整理了一下思緒，“我在尋找我的兩位同事——佛朗西斯·摩爾根博士，他是考古學教授，以及沃倫·萊斯，一位語言學教授。沃倫本來要與我共進晚餐，一同討論幾項重大發現，但他卻意外失蹤了。一開始我沒有在意，但現在，我有一種不太好的預感，可能事情沒有這麼簡單。我總覺得這樣的事情以前也發生過……”阿米蒂奇已無法像往常那樣冷靜，他拿著酒杯的手微微顫抖。“我試著找佛朗西斯，他或許知道沃倫在哪兒，但我也聯繫不上他。他就喜歡在賭場裡鬼混，別人是這麼告訴我的。”\n"
"“我現在很擔心沃倫的安危，我現在能指望的人就剩你了。如果你肯幫我找到他，我會很感激你的。當然，如果你能找到佛朗西斯幫忙，就再好不過了。”"
