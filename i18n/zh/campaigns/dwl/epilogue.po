"Six months had passed, and life for Curtis Whateley was finally returning to normal. Since they’d hushed up the incident and the authorities kept their distance from these parts, Mr. Osborn had auctioned off the Ericks and Bishop families’ belongings. Joe took a few trinkets for himself, of course, but Curtis wanted nothing to do with it. Folk already didn’t trust him on account of his family’s sins, even though he’d been attending church on the regular and had stayed far away from anything resembling the arcane.\n"
"Even so, Curtis could not shake a sense of foreboding. He’d seen the devastation that befell the Ericks, Bishop, and Frye homes. He’d even seen firsthand the creature the folks from Arkham had banished. Some days, his thoughts led him to Wilbur Whateley’s farm, where he would stand outside and stare for hours, too scared to enter, but too curious to leave. Maybe there was something in there that could make these terrible visions depart. Something that could give him strength enough to resist the nightmares. Curtis decided he would find it."

"六個月後，柯蒂斯·沃特雷的生活終於回到了原本的軌跡。之前的一段時間，警察和政府調查人員都不停地找他問話。奧斯本先生把埃里克和畢曉普家的遺物都拍賣掉了。喬買下了一些東西，柯蒂斯甚麼都沒要。村民們已經開始意識到沃特雷這個姓氏，可能和邪惡有所聯繫。儘管柯蒂斯還是像往常一樣，每週去一次教堂，並且表示對魔法毫無興趣，大家依然漸漸與他疏遠了。\n"
"柯蒂斯心中一直很不安，那是一種強烈的預感。畢竟，他見證了埃里克、畢曉普、弗萊三家人的房屋被毀。他親眼見過阿卡姆的人驅逐的那個怪物。有一天，他路過威爾伯·沃特雷的農場，在那兒駐足良久，呆呆地凝望著。他不敢走進去，但是卻因為好奇而不肯離開。假如裡面有能讓人忘卻過去的藥水呢？假如裡面有能讓它充滿勇氣，去對抗那些惡夢的護符呢？他決定進去察看一番。"

"Gené knelt closer to the ground to examine the sign in the dirt. The shape of the sign was foreign to her, and the tracks that had led to it were unlike any she’d ever seen. Coupled with the report from the university…she wasn’t sure what to think. “Ms. Beauregard,” her assistant called out to her, “have you found something?”\n"
"Gené stood and turned to face the freshman who’d been assigned to her. He was a good kid and a bit callow, but a hard worker and eager to prove himself. “This place was supposed to be cordoned off,” Gené responded. “Nobody’s lived here for months. And yet, see for yourself: their primitive rites continue to this day.”\n"
"The student approached and joined Gené in examining the sign, flipping through the pages of his journal to reference its symbols. “What do you think it means?” he asked. She shook her head. Outsiders rarely traveled to Dunwich, and all the signposts leading to the village had been taken down. But these days, even the townsfolk who had called this place home had abandoned it.\n"
"“I don’t know,” Gené admitted. “But somebody is here, and this isn’t the first sign we’ve seen like this. Stories say there’s an altar where the townsfolk would conduct pagan rituals atop that hill. Maybe we’ll find more up there.”"

"金妮跪在地上，仔細地檢查著刻著的那個符號。她從未見過這個符號，這兒那條深深的印痕，也不像是她見過的生物。她快速翻閱了大學提供給她的報告，感到毫無頭緒。“博勒加德小姐，”她的助手在叫她的名字，“你發現了什麼嗎？”\n"
"金妮站了起來，轉向那個新來的菜鳥。他是個好學生，可惜太過於不諳世事，急於證明自己的價值。“這個區域已經有好幾個月沒有人居住了。”金妮回答道，“你看，他們宗教用的儀式場地還留在這兒。”\n"
"那個學生走過來，也蹲下檢查地面的印記，然後快速翻找自己的筆記本，想要看看是否有類似的符號。“你覺得這象徵著什麼？”他問。金妮搖了搖頭。以前就不太有人來敦威治，自從指向敦溫致的標示牌被撤掉後，連本地人都拋棄了他們的家園。\n"
"“我無法理解，”金妮陷入沉思。“這不是我們第一次看到這個符號了，做這些事的肯定是同一批人。報告裡說，這兒曾經有個祭壇，而且這個村的村民，會在那邊的山峰上舉行宗教儀式。走吧，我們去山上看看，可能會發現什麼。”"
