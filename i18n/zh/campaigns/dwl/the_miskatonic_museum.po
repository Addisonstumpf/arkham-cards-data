"Several months ago, Armitage and his colleagues stopped a rampaging horror from tearing through Dunwich, a backwater town several hours north and west of Arkham. At first you imagine this beast as a rabid bear, or worse, but the professor’s description of the creature paints a different picture.\n"
"It all began when a man named Wilbur Whateley entered the Orne Library looking for Olaus Wormius’s Latin translation of a book called the Necronomicon. Wilbur already possessed a beaten-up English translation by Dr. John Dee, but it was insufficient for his purposes. Armitage turned the man away, fearing what use the strange man had for the book. Whateley returned in secret, hoping to steal the book, but was attacked by a hound guarding the university. Armitage, Rice, and Morgan later discovered Whateley’s body. A description of the foul corpse—semi-anthropomorphic and covered in fur, with a leathery hide and greenish-grey tentacles—causes you to question whether or not Whateley was truly human."

"幾個月前，阿米蒂奇和他的同事前往了阿卡姆西北方向的敦威治，在那兒阻止了一場驚天大陰謀。一開始，你覺得那個怪物只是熊，或者那一類的東西，但是教授述說的內容卻大相逕庭。\n"
"一切都要從一個叫威爾伯·沃特雷的男子說起，他進入奧恩圖書館，查找奧洛斯·沃爾密烏斯翻譯的拉丁文版《死靈之書》。威爾伯已經有一本破舊的，約翰·迪伊翻譯的英文版《死靈之書》，但他好像並不滿足於此。阿米蒂奇拒絕了那個男子，他擔心書被惡人利用。不過沃特雷還是悄悄回來了，想要偷走書，卻被看門狗咬傷。後來，阿米蒂奇、萊斯和摩爾根找到了沃特雷的屍體，樣子十分慘烈。他變得像是野獸和人的混合體，粗糙的皮膚上長滿毛髮，還長出了灰綠色的觸手。你開始懷疑，沃特雷真的是人類嗎？"

msgid "The notes written by Dr. Armitage in the journal stress Whateley’s desire to get his hands on the Necronomicon for some terrible purpose. As you read on, it seems that Dr. Armitage brought the university’s copy of the tome to Harold Walsted—the curator of the Miskatonic Museum—for safekeeping in the museum’s Restricted Hall. Although you are worried about your mentor, you are equally worried that Armitage’s kidnappers might get their hands on this Necronomicon. You decide to head to the museum to prevent them from acquiring it."
msgstr "阿米蒂奇的日記裡，強調了沃特雷拿取《死靈之書》別有用意。你繼續閱讀，看到阿米蒂奇博士為了保證書籍的安全，將它交給了大學博物館的館長——哈羅德·維爾斯特，讓他將書籍放到博物館的限制區妥善保存。儘管你擔心自己導師的安危，但你同樣擔心綁匪染指《死靈之書》。於是你決定前往博物館阻止他們。"

msgid "“My colleagues and I were quick to put the ordeal behind us,” Armitage says with a sigh. “But it seems that things haven’t fully resolved themselves. I’ll tell you the rest later, but for now, it is imperative that we get our hands on that copy of the Necronomicon. If my instincts are correct, the assailants you’ve encountered will be searching for it. After all that transpired, I didn’t feel safe keeping it at the library, so I brought it to my good friend, Harold Walsted. He is the current curator of the Miskatonic Museum. I thought it would be safe in the museum’s Restricted Hall, but now I’m not so sure. You must retrieve it at all costs! I fear terribly what they could do with the rites contained in its pages…”"
msgstr "“我們三個很快就忘了此事，”阿米蒂奇嘆了一口氣，“但看起來事情還未結束。我之後會告訴你們剩下的故事，但現在，《死靈之書》才是最重要的。我有一種預感，那些人不會放棄這本書的。所以我提前將書移出了圖書館，交給了我的好朋友——米斯卡塔尼克大學博物館館長，哈羅德·維爾斯特先生保管。我曾以為這本書待在博物館的限制區足夠安全，但現在我不敢如此斷言。你必須不惜一切代價取回它！我擔心他們會運用書裡的儀式來做可怕的事情……”"

msgstr "該冒險中，部分卡牌會提及“混沌”區域。混沌是場外區域的一部分，在場景與密謀牌堆旁邊，用於放置追獵恐魔。當追獵恐魔在混沌中時，被視為離場，不能被玩家卡牌和調查員行動影響。"

msgid "Whatever the creature in the museum was, you had neither the will nor the tools to destroy it. It seems you must give up any hope of recovering the Necronomicon. Even so, there are others depending on you. Gathering your courage, you prepare for your next task."
msgstr "不管博物館裡的那個東西是什麼，你都決定放棄，離開這兒。你知道自己不夠勇敢，也沒有好的武器，看來《死靈之書》也徹底與你無緣了。不管怎樣，還是有人期待著你。何不振作起來，自信地迎接下個任務呢？"

msgid "As long as this translation of the Necronomicon exists, there will be sorcerers and other foul agents like Whateley seeking it. In the end, you know what must be done to protect humanity from the threats you’ve seen. You find a trash bin and fill it with books and documents, throwing the Necronomicon on top. It takes several matches to set the contents of the bin alight. The flames fill the room with heat and the creeping shadows retreat from its light. You watch the book burn for some time, its pages turning to ash. You can only hope you’ve made the right decision."
msgstr "只要這本《死靈之書》還在，就會有更多像沃特雷那樣的狂熱分子，永無止境地尋找這本書。能夠保護人類的方法就是淨化這罪惡，唯一能淨化罪惡的就是灼熱的火焰。你把垃圾桶裡填滿紙，又把《死靈之書》放在最上面。你劃燃幾根火柴，點燃了垃圾桶。火焰傳來的溫暖充斥了整個房間，火光越燒越烈，逼退了牆上的黑影。你看著這本書被燒成灰燼，只希望你所做的決定是正確的。"

msgid "The Necronomicon is more than just a book; it is a tool. Within its pages is a wealth of information about the forces and creatures you have encountered. Knowing how useful it could be in your endeavors, how could you possibly bring yourself to destroy it? Besides, as long as you keep the book safely in your possession, you will still be foiling those who wish to use it for nefarious purposes."
msgstr "《死靈之書》不僅僅是一本書，它還可以受用於你。在這本書中記載著許多與你所遭遇的勢力和生物有關的信息。考慮到它對你來說作用斐然，你怎可把它毀了呢？而且，只要你隨身帶著它，就能防止別人利用它作惡。"
