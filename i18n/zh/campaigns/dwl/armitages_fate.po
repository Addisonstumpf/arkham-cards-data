"You are more than a little rattled by your experiences in the university and the Clover Club. You’re not sure what to make of whoever—or whatever—was after Rice and Morgan. Worried about Dr. Armitage, you swiftly make your way back to his home. When you arrive, you find that the latches of his front door have been busted open, and his living area and study have been ransacked. Dr. Armitage is nowhere to be found. Searching his home, you find a journal the intruders didn’t steal tucked beneath several other documents in the bottom drawer of Armitage’s desk.\n"
"The journal appears to be written in a strange language you cannot decode, using a script you’ve never seen in your entire life. Fortunately, it seems Dr. Armitage had already gone through the trouble of translating it into English. Apparently, it belongs to one “Wilbur Whateley.” The journal—along with Armitage’s many notes—tells a startling tale, one you would scarcely believe had it not been for your harrowing experiences earlier tonight…"

"你對照著阿米蒂奇的紙條，讀完了日誌的內容，這真是個奇怪的故事，看完不禁令人毛骨悚然，甚至比你今晚遭遇的事情還要恐怖……"

"When you arrive at Dr. Armitage’s home in Southside, you find him sitting at his desk, pale-faced and sweating with worry. He is grateful to you for searching for his colleagues, but he doesn’t look relieved. With a long pause, he straightens his glasses and explains:\n"
"“I’m afraid I must apologize. There’s something I didn’t mention to you earlier.” Dr. Armitage then spins a tale you would scarcely believe had it not been for your harrowing experiences earlier that night…"

"你回到了南區阿米蒂奇的家，他依然坐在寫字桌前，臉色蒼白，滿頭是汗。他對你的協助表示感激，但依然沒有表現出輕鬆的樣子。一段時間的沉默後，他扶了扶眼鏡，說道：\n"
"“我想我必須要向你道歉。有一件事我一直瞞著你。”阿米蒂奇終於開口說出了真相，但是那卻比今晚你的遭遇更為可怕…"
