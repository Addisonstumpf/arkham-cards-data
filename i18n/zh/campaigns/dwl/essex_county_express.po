"Recent events in the Museum have forced you to re-evaluate Armitage’s tale about Dunwich. It cannot be a coincidence—Wilbur Whateley, the Necronomicon, the creature from Dunwich, and the people and creatures who attacked here in Arkham—everything must be connected. You’re certain now where you must head: the lonely and dismal town of Dunwich Village.\n"
"You consider telling the Massachusetts State Police what you know, but the negative consequences outweigh the potential gain. Given the nature of your story, they would likely write your stories off as an absurd hoax. Worse, they could lock you up. After all, you were present in an illegal speakeasy, and you also trespassed in the museum. Instead, you decide to head to Dunwich yourself, in order to investigate further.\n"
"You pack everything you think you might need and manage to get some rest for the night. In the morning, you head to the train station in Northside and purchase a last-minute express ticket. Dunwich is several hours by train northwest along the Miskatonic River Valley. There is no train station in Dunwich, but you manage to phone one of Armitage’s acquaintances in the small village: a man by the name of Zebulon Whateley who was present during the events several months ago.\n"
"Armitage’s notes indicate that the Whateley family is spread across many branches, some decadent and unscrupulous, others “undecayed” or otherwise untouched by nefarious and diabolic rites. According to Armitage, Zebulon’s branch of the family lay somewhere between the decayed and undecayed Whateleys, who knew of the traditions of his ancestors, but was not corrupted by them. He agrees to pick you up at the closest station and drive you into town\n"
"As the train departs from Arkham, you feel the events of the previous night catching up to you, and exhaustion sets in. But before you can safely reach your destination, the train car suddenly rumbles and shakes, startling you out of your reverie. The train loudly skids to a violent halt, and you hear a rattling noise behind you…"

"博物館裡的怪事，真的和阿米蒂奇說的那個敦威治村沒有關係嗎？你覺得這應該不是巧合，威爾伯·沃特雷、死靈之書、敦威治的怪物、攻擊阿卡姆的神祕團體，這背後肯定有甚麼關聯。你在心裡浮現了一個可以解答你心中疑問的地點：隔離於世的小村——敦威治。\n"
"你本想向馬薩諸塞州的警局報告此案，但說出此事弊大於利。而且你經歷的事件過於詭異，他們可能只會把這當作是一則荒誕的惡作劇。甚至他們還可能把你關起來。畢竟你曾在一家非法的地下酒吧出現，還侵入了博物館。於是你不向警局報案，而是自行前往敦威治深入調查。\n"
"你把所有需要的東西都裝進了行李，並好好睡了一晚。第二天清早，你就去了北區的火車站，購買了下一班特快列車的票。敦威治並不算太遠，火車只需要沿著米斯卡塔尼克河，往西北開幾個小時就能到。敦威治沒有火車站，你給阿米蒂奇的一個熟人——西布倫·沃特雷打了個電話。西布倫在幾個月前被攪入了這個事件中。\n"
"阿米蒂奇的筆記中曾提到，沃特雷家族有許多分支，有些已經衰敗且道德淪喪，而其他“未衰敗”的分支並未受到邪惡儀式影響。據阿米蒂奇所言，西布倫所屬的分支處於衰敗與未衰敗之間，他清楚家族祖先的傳統，但未被其腐化心智。他答應到最近的火車站接你，再將你載回敦威治。\n"
"當火車駛離阿卡姆，你感到前幾個夜晚的事件不停地在腦中浮現，這令你萬分疲勞。火車突然停了下來。你感到整個車廂都在不停地搖晃，身後傳來吵雜的聲響……"

msgid "Your experience beyond the gate is simultaneously terrifying and impossible to recall with clarity. A hypnotic spectacle of lights, otherworldly sensations, and altered geometry dances at the tattered edges of your mind. An unearthly voice from beyond rings in your ears, its significance an enigma. When you awaken, you find yourself in the woods, several miles from the Miskatonic River. Destroyed train cars surround you. They are crumpled as if from a severe impact; they are also decayed as if years of rust and squalor have claimed them. There is no sign of the other passengers."
msgstr "裂縫把你們帶入了一個完全不同的世界，那裡的光景十分可怕，你的記憶被恐懼佔領，無法清晰地想起那裡到底發生了什麼。一道令人昏沉欲睡的光芒驟現，帶來超脫塵世的感受，彷彿有無窮變換的圖形在你思緒崩壞的邊緣舞動。一道神秘的聲音在你的耳旁響起，你對這聲音的內容毫無頭緒。當你醒來時，你發現自己身處米斯卡塔尼克河幾英里以外的森林中。支離破碎的火車車廂散落在你周圍。車體佈滿皺紋，看起來經受了嚴重的衝擊；車體還破敗不已，其髒污和鏽蝕就像經過了數年一般。而其他乘客已不見蹤影。"

One passenger mentions “a pipe bursting in the rear car,” and that quickly becomes the explanation for the innocent and ignorant, those who either cannot or choose not to delve further into the mystery. You, on the other hand, know better… although in hindsight, you wish you didn’t."
msgstr "看到車廂後方的巨大裂縫瓦解，你總算鬆了一口氣。從這場慘劇存活的幾個乘客似乎無法理解剛才發生了什麼。一位乘客提到“後面的車廂有根管子爆炸了”，這個說法很快得到了那些天真無知的人的認可，反正他們也對真相毫不關心。但你卻和他們不一樣，你知道的比他們更多……儘管經歷此事過後，你寧願自己不曾知道這些事情。"
