msgid "As you flee from the university, you hear screaming from the northern end of the campus. An ambulance passes you by, and you fear the worst.

msgid "You find Professor Rice bound and gagged in the closet of his office. When you free him, he informs you that the strange men and women wandering around the campus had been stalking him for hours. They cornered him in his office and tied him up, although for what purpose, Rice isn’t sure. You inform him that Dr. Armitage sent you, and Rice looks relieved, although he suspects that Dr. Morgan might be in danger as well. Because the strangers on campus seem to have been targeting Professor Rice, you decide that the best course of action is to escort him away from the campus as quickly as possible. As you leave the university, you hear screaming from the northern end of the campus. An ambulance passes you by, and you fear the worst. Hours later, you learn that a ‘rabid dog of some sort’ found its way into the university dormitories. The creature attacked the students inside, and many were mauled or killed in the attack."
msgstr "你在辦公室的一個衣櫃裡找到了萊斯教授，他雙手被人綁住，口裡塞著一團布。你解開了他身上的束縛，他告訴你，在校園中有一群奇怪的人跟蹤他幾個小時了。他們闖入辦公室，把他綁了起來，但是原因卻不明確。你告訴他自己是阿米蒂奇博士派來的，萊斯終於鬆了一口氣。不過他覺得摩爾根博士可能也遇到了危險。考慮到綁架萊斯教授的人可能尚未離開校園，你們護送教授盡快離開了這裡。你們剛踏出校園的門，就聽到從背後傳來了人們的尖叫聲此起彼伏。救護車從你身邊穿過，你心中有種不妙的預感。幾小時後，你聽說有一條“瘋狗一樣的生物”闖進了宿舍，不停地攻擊學生，有很多人被咬傷甚至死去。"

msgid "You pull each of the dormitory’s fire alarms and usher the students out of the building’s north exit, hoping to make your way off campus. Many of the students are confused and exhausted, but you believe an attempt to explain the situation will do more harm than good. Minutes later, a terrible screech echoes across the campus, piercing and shrill. You tell the students to wait and head back to the dormitories to investigate. Oddly, you find no trace of the strange creature—a prospect that worries you more than it relieves you. You hurry to the faculty offices to find Professor Rice, but there is no sign of him anywhere."
msgstr "你拉動了宿舍的火災警報器，學生們全都從宿舍撤離了。大部分人都不知道發生了甚麼，但是你清楚，不告訴他們應該是最好的做法。幾分鐘後，校園裡響起了恐怖的吼叫聲，如此地尖銳而可怕。你告訴學生們不要到處亂跑，然後回到宿舍進行調查。奇怪的是，這裡沒有任何奇怪的生物，這並未讓你感到放鬆，你反而更為憂慮。你跑回辦公室去尋找萊斯教授，但是這裡沒有任何人。"

The creature attacked the students inside, and many were mauled or killed in the attack."
msgstr "幾小時後，你終於醒來，渾身是傷，極為疲勞。你不太確定自己到底看到了什麼，只是覺得頭腦一片混亂和恐懼。其他一些倖存者告訴你，有一條“瘋狗一樣的生物”闖進了宿舍，不停地攻擊學生，有很多人被咬傷甚至死去。"
