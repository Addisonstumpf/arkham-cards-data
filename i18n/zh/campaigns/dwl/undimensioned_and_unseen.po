"Your search of the village of Dunwich has uncovered a number of documents, journal entries, and esoteric theories. Reading through these materials leaves you exhausted and emotionally drained. Most of the content was written by a single source—a man named Seth Bishop. When you ask around town, you learn that Seth is a citizen of Dunwich. Along with several others, Seth had witnessed firsthand the devastation wrought by the events of “the Dunwich horror,” as Armitage had dubbed the incident. Curiously, since that time, very few people had seen Seth around town, and those who did claimed his eyes had been bloodshot and his face sweaty and pale.\n"
"You don’t doubt that somebody who has seen what Seth has seen would appear nervous or paranoid. But the more you read of his frantic and unhinged writings, the more you believe he is involved in recent events. His writings speak of having “gathered the remains” and of using arcane methods to “imbue the fathers’ essence” into other creatures, and eventually, into other people. The explanations and diagrams that follow are unfathomably complex and defy understanding.\n"
"Before you are able to find Seth and confront him, several men and women from the village approach you in a panic. “It’s back!” one of them wails. You recognize him as Curtis Whateley, of the undecayed branch. “Whatever it was that killed them Fryes, it’s back! Up and smashed the Bishops’ home like it were made o’ paper!” Curtis and the other townsfolk are clamoring amongst themselves, raising their voices in a panic."

"你在敦威治村展開了調查，找到了大量的文件、日誌、論文。等你閱讀完這些內容，已經感到疲倦不堪。這些文件的作者基本是同一個人——一個叫賽斯·畢曉普的男人。當你向其他村民打聽這個人時，他們告訴你，賽斯的確是本地人。幾個月前發生的“敦威治恐怖事件”(這是阿米蒂奇起的名字)，賽斯就是目擊者之一。奇怪的是，從那之後，賽斯就很少在村裡閒逛，偶而看到他幾回，他都是紅著眼睛，臉色蒼白，滿頭是汗。\n"
"毫無疑問，賽斯已經有點精神失常了。在你深入研究賽斯那些無比瘋狂的文字後，你開始懷疑，他是否參與了這次的事件。他在文件中聲稱已經“發現了父親的遺物”，並且使用了奧術的手段，在一些生物體內“灌入了父親的精華”，最後，他開始把人作為實驗對象。文件中雖然有很多圖表來解釋詳細的流程，但你還是很難理解。\n"
"你決定找出賽斯，當面質問他。不過還沒來得及行動，就聽到村民的叫喊聲：“那玩意回來了！那個殺了弗萊一家的東西回來了！它把畢曉普的家像紙片一樣撕了個粉碎！”正在慌亂叫喊的是柯蒂斯·沃特雷，他是沃特雷家族中和魔法沒甚麼關係的人。柯蒂斯和其他的村民亂成了一鍋粥，大家呼喊著四處逃避。"

"You aim to calm the townsfolk so they can explain to you what is going on. They inform you that there was a rumbling to the north, and when they went to investigate they found the Bishops’ farmhouse had been torn to shreds. A trail of heavy tracks led into nearby Cold Spring Glen. “You know what to do, right? You Arkham folk stopped that thing last time,” one of the townsfolk says. Curtis shakes his head and bites at his lip.\n"
"“We couldn’t even see that hellish thing until the old professor sprayed that there powder on it,” He says. “To this day,I wish I hadn’t seen it at all…” Something must be done to stop the monster’s rampage. But, if the documents you found are true, there may be more than one such creature on the loose…."

"你試著讓村民們冷靜下來，好向你解釋到底發生了什麼。他們告訴你，在村子北邊發生了地震，當有人去看時，發現畢曉普的農場幾乎被夷為平地。地上有一道深深的痕跡，直接通往冷泉幽谷。“你們知道該怎麼辦的吧？上次阿卡姆來的人，就成功保護了村子。”有一個村民說道。\n"
"柯蒂斯嚇得快哭了，他緊緊咬著嘴唇，不停地搖頭。“我們都看不到那個東西，那個怪物只有用教授製作的粉末才會現身，”他說道，“現在我才不想看到那個怪物……”看來有人必須要去阻止那怪物。但是如果你們發現的文件內容是真的話，怪物絕對不只一隻……"
