"When you finally reach Dunwich, you are greeted by Zebulon Whateley and Earl Sawyer, another man from the village who had met with Dr. Armitage during the incident several months ago. “Things ain’t lookin’ too good here,” Earl tells you. “Some folk up and went missin’ a few nights ago. ‘Dem whippoorwills won’ shut up. Dunno what yer doin’ here, but last time you Arkham folk came ‘round it was bad news. Very bad news.” His eyes blink rapidly, and he coughs and looks away.\n"
"“Look, why don’t you rest fer the night an’ look fer whatever it is yer looking fer t’morra,” Zebulon chimes in, putting a wrinkled hand on your shoulder. You begin to protest, but your aching muscles and weary mind won’t allow you to refuse. The elderly man offers to take you in for the night, and drives you to his home at the outskirts of Dunwich village. The town is disheveled and eerie, and you find yourself wishing you hadn’t come here at all. You fall asleep on the ride over and scarcely remember anything else from that night.\n"
"When you awaken, you find that Zebulon’s house is abandoned, and there is no sign of the elderly man, or of Mr. Sawyer. Fearing the worst, you head into the village of Dunwich to investigate, hoping to find answers."

"經過長途跋涉，你終於抵達了敦威治，迎接你的是西布倫·沃特雷和厄爾·索耶。厄爾是阿米蒂奇在幾個月前的事件中認識的村民。“這兒最近簡直要人命，”厄爾抱怨道，“前幾天老是有人失蹤，該死的夜鷹叫個不停。我不曉得你來做啥，但你們這些城裡人上次來了就沒好事。”他眨了眨眼，假裝咳嗽了一下，就看向了另一邊。\n"
"“兄弟，今晚就好好休息吧，那些破東西明天再找也成。”西布倫打破了尷尬的局面，直接把一隻手臂搭在你的肩上。你想要閃躲，但是肌肉疼痛，再加上精神恍惚，也只好忍耐西布倫不合時宜的稱兄道弟。那老頭建議你今晚睡他家，將你載到郊外，他的家中。這個小村氣氛十分古怪，你頓時有點後悔，如果當初不來該多好。你在車上睡著了，幾乎忘了那晚發生的所有事。\n"
"當你醒來時，西布倫家空無一人。那個老頭已經不在了，就連索耶先生也不在。你有種不好的預感，於是立刻趕往村中心，希望找到一絲線索。"

The creature’s body begins to shrink and melt away as the incantation builds, its cries terrifying and haunting. In the end, all that is left is the disfigured corpse of a man—Silas Bishop. You find a silver pendant emblazoned with an odd constellation tucked into his shirt. You take it with you, hoping to find a use for it."

With no time to spare, you recite the incantation, stumbling over the words and feeling your throat tighten with each sentence. The creature’s body begins to shrink and melt away as the incantation continues, its cries terrifying and haunting.
