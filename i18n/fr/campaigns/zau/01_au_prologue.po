"The call had been rather questionable - a muffled, distorted voice, entreating you to meet it at midnight, that the fate of the world depended on it. Outlandish, yes, but the caller knew things, things that almost no-one knows about you. It wasn't quite blackmail, but rather a promise of trustworthiness. A promise that everything would be explained soon. \n"
"You feel a little foolish as you trudge home. Like some cruel trick has been played upon you. Probably you shouldn't have gone, but something made you want to believe the voice on the other end of the phone. Foolish. \n"
"Bright, flickering light almost blinds you. You blink rapidly, and as your eyes adjust the blinding hues resolve into an image of fire and fury. Your home is ablaze, an inferno so fierce and hot that it couldn't not be deliberate. Somebody trying to kill you? But why? \n"
