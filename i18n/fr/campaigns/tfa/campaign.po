"At certain points throughout The Forgotten Age campaign, investigators are given the opportunity to choose supplies to bring on their expeditions into the wilds. These supplies are recorded in the Campaign Log, under each investigator’s “Supplies” section.\n"
"Supplies are purchased with supply points, which are granted to investigators whenever they are given the opportunity to purchase supplies. Leftover supply points are not recorded, and are lost.\n"
"An investigator’s supplies will determine the possible options available during gameplay and throughout the story of this campaign. <b>Each supply has no effect on its own.</b> Some card effects, story options, and resolutions may change or become available depending on the supplies carried by the investigator(s)."

"Some encounter cards are worth vengeance points. The text <b>Vengeance X</b> indicates that a card is worth X vengeance points.\n"
"Like <b>Victory X</b>, when an encounter card with <b>Vengeance X</b> is overcome by the investigators, it is stored in the victory display until the end of the scenario. However, unlike victory points, vengeance represents the awareness and animosity of the Father of Serpents, and it is generally a good idea to avoid accruing vengeance points whenever possible.\n"
"Vengeance points in the victory display have no impact upon the game unless specifically referenced by another encounter card."

"Some abilities in this campaign are identified with an <b>Explore</b> action designator. Such abilities are generally used to find new locations to put into play, and are initiated using the “activate” action.\n"
"<b>Explore</b> abilities instruct you to draw the top card of the “exploration deck,” which is a separate deck that is constructed during the setup of some scenarios. This deck consists of several single-sided locations and treachery cards."
msgstr ""

msgid "Each <b>Explore</b> ability indicates a particular type of location that you are seeking to draw. <b>If a location of that type is drawn, it is put into play, and you move to that location.</b> This is considered a “successful” exploration."

msgid "If any other location is drawn, place it next to the exploration deck, and draw the next card from the exploration deck. Repeat this process until a location of the indicated type is drawn, or a treachery is drawn. After this action has ended, shuffle each location next to the exploration deck back into the exploration deck."

msgid "If a treachery card is drawn, it is resolved as normal. If it is discarded, place it in the encounter discard pile as you would normally. There is no discard pile for the exploration deck. This is considered an “unsuccessful” exploration."
