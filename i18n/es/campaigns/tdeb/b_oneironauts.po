"<i>Following scenario 2–B, the investigators have finally reached the end of the mysterious stairway…</i>\n"
"The black cat awaits you at the bottom of the stairs, watching your long descent with distant, unblinking eyes. You are about to ask how the cat got there when it cuts you off. “Don’t bother. You wouldn’t understand.” It curls up on the cold stone floor, lounging amid the bleak environment. "

msgid "“Where’s blondie?” the black cat asks, peering around. You remain silent, in anguish. “Ah. I see.” The cat examines its paw. It doesn’t seem to care that your companion did not survive the descent. “Well, that seems to have resolved itself nicely,” it says to itself cryptically."

msgid "“Well, since you clearly don’t need my help, I’ll be off now. Just wanted to check to see if you’re still alive. And look at that! You are. For now. Bye then.” Before you get the chance to reply, the black cat wanders off, its pitch-black fur melding into the darkness of the Underworld."

msgid "You’ve about had it with this cat’s cryptic half-truths and nonanswers. You rail at the beast. How are you supposed to help when you might as well be stumbling in the dark? The black cat sits up and narrows its gaze. “I did not know if you could be trusted. To be honest, I am still unsure. I have had visions of these events for many, many years now. I know some of what may come to pass, but not everything. You could be the ones who will save all of us…or the fools who herald our doom.” The cat’s justification is convenient, but it does explain how it has known where to find you at every turn. You try to persuade the cat to trust you, but it remains unconvinced. “Tell you what. Beneath the surface of the Sea of Pitch lies a passageway between realms. That is where you need to go to stop this world from merging with yours. Make it there in one piece, and I’ll tell you everything. But first, I have somewhere else to be. Your pals need me, too.”"
