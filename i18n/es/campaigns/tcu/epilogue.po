"“Gone? What do you mean she’s gone?!” Sheriff Engle demands.\n"
"“See for yourself,” the officer replies. He guides the sheriff through a long hallway flanked by holding cells. “She was guarded at all hours, trust me. One moment she was there, the next…” He stops in front of Anette’s cell, and watches as Sheriff Engle’s jaw drops. Smeared along the walls of the cell is a sticky red substance, painted in a delicate pattern. The woman is nowhere to be seen."

msgid "You nod to the knight as he places the file you had requested onto your hardwood desk. Finding all of Carl Sanford’s records hadn’t been easy, but now all of the secrets of the Order were within your grasp. “What is the next step?” he asks, eager to serve. You inform him that there is to be a meeting in the sanctum this very night. “Very well. I will summon our most loyal members.” You dismiss him and turn to look out the window of your new office. The city of Arkham is as grim and moody as ever…but at least now you can protect it from the forces that lay beyond the Earth."

"Anna regards you calmly as you enter. As always, her prescience is disconcerting, but by now you have gotten used to it. “I’ve been expecting you for some time,” she admits. “I suppose you have questions for me. Very well. Ask away. Though I imagine that by now you must know the answer.” She neither offers you a seat nor a drink. You begin to describe your situation, though the truth of your condition is plain to see for somebody with her gifts (and few else). You had hoped for another explanation— any explanation at all—but it was only a desperate clinging to hope, without justification. Anna gives you a pitying grimace and shakes her head. “Surely by now you must understand. You have completed your task. Your business here has concluded. Now is the time for you to rest and be at peace.”\n"
"Peace? No, you cannot be at peace! There is still so much left for you to do…!"
