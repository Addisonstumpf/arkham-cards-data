"Some abilities in <i>Guardians of the Abyss</i> are identified with an <b>Explore</b> action designator. Such abilities are generally used to find new locations to put into play, and are initiated using the “activate” action.\n"
"<b>Explore</b> abilities instruct you to draw the top card of the “exploration deck,” which is a separate deck that will be constructed during this scenario. This deck consists of several single-sided locations and treachery cards."
msgstr ""

msgid "Each <b>Explore</b> ability indicates a particular type of location that you are seeking to draw. <b>If a location of that type is drawn, it is put into play, and you move to that location.</b> This is considered a “successful” exploration."
msgstr ""

msgid "If any other location is drawn, place it next to the exploration deck, and draw the next card from the exploration deck. Repeat this process until a location of the indicated type is drawn, or a treachery is drawn. After this action has ended, shuffle each location next to the exploration deck back into the exploration deck."
msgstr ""

msgid "If a treachery card is drawn, it is resolved as normal. If it is discarded, place it in the encounter discard pile as you would normally. There is no discard pile for the exploration deck. This is considered an “unsuccessful” exploration."

msgid "Strength of the Abyss"
msgstr ""

msgid "During this scenario, resources on the scenario reference card represent the current strength of the abyss. When you are instructed to add strength to the abyss or remove strength from the abyss, adjust the number of resource tokens on the scenario reference card accordingly. The strength of the abyss has no inherent game effect on its own, though certain encounter card effects may grow stronger or change depending on the current strength of the abyss. Beware—as the abyss grows in strength, so too will the forces set against you. Should it grow too powerful, you will surely fail as Guardians of the Abyss."

msgid "If an effect states that a defeated investigator or [[Ally]] asset has been <i>“taken by the abyss,”</i> that character has been afflicted by a curse which puts them in a comatose state. When an investigator or [[Ally]] asset is <i>taken by the abyss</i>, first add 1 strength to the abyss. Then, if that card was unique, record in the campaign log that <i>“(card name) was taken by the abyss.”</i> An investigator who has been <i>taken by the abyss</i> is treated as if he or she was killed or driven insane. Additionally, for the remainder of the campaign, players cannot play copies of any unique [[Ally]] asset who has been <i>taken by the abyss.</i>"

"Story cards are a new cardtype in this scenario. These cards serve as an avenue for additional narrative and typically appear as the reverse side of another scenario card. When you are instructed to resolve a story card, simply read its story text and resolve its game text, if any.\n"
"<i>(Note: When a location or enemy that is in play is flipped over to a story card on its other side, that location or enemy is still considered to be in play while that story card is being resolved.)</i>"

"Winlock fiddles with his mustache for a moment while he considers your words. As the leader of the expedition currently scouring through Dashur, the decision of whether or not to let you join the expedition is up to him. “Look, I read through the evidence you gathered. I know about what happened in Cairo. I believe your story. But, still…” He lets out an exasperated sigh. “I just don’t know how I’m going to convince the rest of the expedition crew. Ancient temples is one thing, but a gate to another dimension? This ‘Xzharah’ fellow? None of this can be real, right?”\n"
"Your research and your experience says otherwise. The threat is real. There is a secret organization operating within Egypt—The Brotherhood of the Beast—and if they are not stopped, their newfound “Chosen One” will begin a campaign of destruction that ends with the Earth.\n"
"You insist one last time to be allowed access to the expedition’s resources. “Alright, alright,” Winlock relents. “I don’t know what it is you’re looking for out there in the desert, but I hope you find it.” You shake your head in reply. You’d rather come up empty‑handed."

"“It’s just an arch. Why’re you so worked up, boss?” Winlock crossed his arms. Something about all of this felt wrong. He was sure that this was the place those folks from Arkham were looking for—a delicately patterned archway that led nowhere at all—and yet, Winlock was certain there was something <i>on the other side</i>. “It’s not Egyptian,” he noted, staring at the thing with narrow eyes. “It doesn’t even look…human.”\n"

Creatures of the abyss appear wordlessly at your side, surrounding Xzharah with a quiet, expressionless hate. Xzharah’s sword betrays him and falls from his grip, the blade fracturing as it clatters to the ground. “…The prophecy must be fulfilled…” It is the last of his vile whispers. His physical form vanishes into the realm’s ethereal mist, and all is silent in the Great Abyss."

msgid "Xzharah places an ice-cold hand on your shoulder as you kneel before him. “You have proven your loyalty,” he decrees. Creatures of the abyss surround you, heads bowed in reverence to their new master. There are none left to oppose him. “Few of your kind have the wit or the will to see beyond the present. To see our prophecy fulfilled. But you are worthy enough to have your eyes opened. Far worthier than the fools I have trusted in the past.” He bids you to stand, and places the handle of his blood-soaked sword in your hands. “Now arise, Servant of the Beast, and take your place among us.”"
