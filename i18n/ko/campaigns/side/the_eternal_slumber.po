"Some abilities in <i>Guardians of the Abyss</i> are identified with an <b>Explore</b> action designator. Such abilities are generally used to find new locations to put into play, and are initiated using the “activate” action.\n"
"<b>Explore</b> abilities instruct you to draw the top card of the “exploration deck,” which is a separate deck that will be constructed during this scenario. This deck consists of several single-sided locations and treachery cards."

msgid "When a single-sided location is put into play from the exploration deck, place clues on that location equal to its clue value."

msgid "<i>Example: Act 1a—“Search for the Gate” has the following ability: “[action]: <b>Explore</b>. Draw the top card of the exploration deck. If it is a connecting location, put it into play and move to it.” Ursula Downs is at the Expedition Camp and wishes to find a new location to travel to. She spends her first action to explore, drawing the top card of the exploration deck. The card she draws is Desert Oasis. Because Desert Oasis is a location that is not connected to the Expedition Camp, it is placed next to the exploration deck, and Ursula draws the next card in the exploration deck. This time, she draws the Sandstorm treachery card, which she resolves as normal and places in the encounter discard pile. Her exploration is unsuccessful, and she must shuffle the Desert Oasis that she drew previously back into the exploration deck. Ursula decides to explore one more time, spending a second action. This time, she draws Nile River, which is connected to the Expedition Camp. Her exploration is successful. Nile River is put into play with clues on it equal to its clue value, and Ursula immediately moves from the Expedition Camp to the Nile River.</i>"

"Story cards are a new cardtype in this scenario. These cards serve as an avenue for additional narrative and typically appear as the reverse side of another scenario card. When you are instructed to resolve a story card, simply read its story text and resolve its game text, if any.\n"
"<i>(Note: When a location or enemy that is in play is flipped over to a story card on its other side, that location or enemy is still considered to be in play while that story card is being resolved.)</i>"

msgstr ""

msgid "During this scenario, resources on the scenario reference card represent the current strength of the abyss. When you are instructed to add strength to the abyss or remove strength from the abyss, adjust the number of resource tokens on the scenario reference card accordingly. The strength of the abyss has no inherent game effect on its own, though certain encounter card effects may grow stronger or change depending on the current strength of the abyss. Beware—as the abyss grows in strength, so too will the forces set against you. Should it grow too powerful, you will surely fail as Guardians of the Abyss."

msgid "If an effect states that a defeated investigator or [[Ally]] asset has been <i>“taken by the abyss,”</i> that character has been afflicted by a curse which puts them in a comatose state. When an investigator or [[Ally]] asset is <i>taken by the abyss</i>, first add 1 strength to the abyss. Then, if that card was unique, record in the campaign log that <i>“(card name) was taken by the abyss.”</i> An investigator who has been <i>taken by the abyss</i> is treated as if he or she was killed or driven <b>insane</b>. Additionally, for the remainder of the campaign, players cannot play copies of any unique [[Ally]] asset who has been <i>taken by the abyss.</i>"

"<fancy>Greetings,</fancy>\n"
"<fancy>I'm sorry. I know it has been some time since my last correspondence. I am writing to you now because there is nobody I can trust here in Cairo. I don't even know if this letter will make it to you safely. I can only hope it does, for all our sakes.</fancy>\n"
"<fancy>There's something wrong in this city. It started a few weeks ago. The head curator of the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities fell asleep and simply never awoke. I thought nothing of it at first; just a medical curiosity, a mystery the doctors would solve in due time. But then it happened again. And again. More and more, people all across the city started falling into comas. Now it's happening every night. . . And as I write to you, they are taking my husband John to the hospital.</fancy>\n"
"<fancy>I'm scared. I don't want to fall asleep and never wake up again. But more than that, I'm worried that there are people purposely inflicting this curse on others. And if so, why?</fancy>\n"
"<fancy>Please, I am begging you. I need your help.</fancy>\n"

You will see. He will bend your will just as he did mine.” Her shadow grows and warps , misshapen. “It is the Abyss he wants. If you wish to stop him, head west. Xzharah awaits beyond the Gate.” Neith’s shadow consumes her body whole, and she vanishes from sight. Only her amulet remains."
