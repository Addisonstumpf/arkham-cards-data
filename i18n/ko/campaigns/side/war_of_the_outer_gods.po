msgid "Swarming X"
msgstr "무리 X"

msgid "An enemy with the swarming X keyword is actually a pack of enemies operating in unison. After you put an enemy with the swarming X keyword into play, place the top X cards of your deck facedown underneath the enemy as swarm cards, without looking at them. The enemy they are underneath is called the “host enemy.” Some scenario card effects may also instruct a player to add swarm cards to an enemy. This is done using the same process."

"'무리 X'는 키워드 기능입니다.\n"
"무리 X' 키워드를 가진 적은 하나가 아니라 여러 개체가 무리지어 움직이는 적을 뜻합니다. 당신이 '무리 X' 키워드를 가진 적을 플레이 영역에 둔 후, 당신의 덱 맨 위 카드 X장을 가져와 앞면을 보지 않고서 그 적 밑에 놓습니다. 이렇게 밑에 놓은 카드를 \"무리 카드\"라고 부르며, '무리 X' 키워드를 가진 적 카드를 \"우두머리 적\"(혹은 간단히 \"우두머리\")이라고 부릅니다. 몇몇 시나리오 효과가 플레이어에게 적 하나에게 \"무리 카드\"를 추가하라고 지시할 수도 있습니다. 이 경우에도 위와 동일한 방법으로 플레이어 카드를 우두머리 밑에 놓습니다."

msgstr "누가 무리 카드를 추가해야 할지 불분명하다면, 대표 조사자의 덱에서 무리 카드를 가져옵니다."

msgid "Each swarm card underneath the host enemy acts as a separate instance of that enemy for most purposes. Each swarm card has the same values and text as its host card. <i>(For example, if an investigator is engaged with a host enemy with 2 swarm cards underneath it, that investigator is engaged with 3 enemies in total.)</i>"
msgstr "우두머리 적 밑에 있는 모든 무리 카드는 대부분의 경우 개별적으로 작용합니다. 모든 무리 카드는 우두머리 적과 동일한 수치값, 문구를 갖습니다<i>(예시: 무리 카드 2장이 깔린 우두머리와 교전하고 있는 조사자는 동시에 적 셋과 교전하고 있는 것입니다)</i>."

msgid "Each swarm card attacks separately when enemies attack during the enemy phase. Once the host enemy and all of its swarm cards have attacked during this step, exhaust all of them."
msgstr "적 단계 동안 적이 공격할 때, 모든 무리 카드는 개별적으로 공격을 합니다. 이 과정에서 우두머리 적과 그에 딸린 무리 카드가 모두 공격을 한 번씩 했다면, 이들을 한꺼번에 소진시킵니다."

msgid "Each swarm card can be attacked or dealt damage separately, but the host enemy cannot be defeated while it still has swarm cards underneath it. When a swarm card is defeated, any excess damage may be dealt to another swarm card underneath the same host enemy or to the host enemy itself. <i>(For example, Tony Morgan uses a .41 Derringer to attack a Stealthy Zoog with 2 swarm cards. The attack deals 2 damage. The first point of damage defeats 1 of the 2 swarm cards, so the excess point of damage may be dealt to another swarm card, defeating it as well.)</i>"
msgstr "모든 무리 카드는 피해를 받거나 공격을 당할 때에도 서로 별개로 간주합니다. 하지만 우두머리 적 밑에 무리 카드가 있다면 우두머리 적을 쓰러뜨릴 수 없습니다. 무리 카드 하나가 쓰러질 때, 초과분의 피해를 해당 무리에 있는 다른 무리 카드나 우두머리 적에게 할당해도 됩니다<i>(예시: '토니 모건'이 '41구경 데린저'를 사용해서 무리 카드가 2개인 '잠행하는 주그'를 공격합니다. 이번 공격은 피해를 2 줍니다. 그 중 피해 1로 무리 카드 2장 중 1장을 쓰러뜨리고, 나머지 피해 1을 다른 무리 카드 1장에 할당하여 그것도 쓰러뜨립니다)</i>."

msgid "Anytime a swarm card leaves play, place it on the bottom of its owner’s deck. If you are unsure of the owner of the swarm card, you may look at it to determine its owner."
msgstr "언제든 무리 카드가 플레이 영역에서 나갈 때, 그 카드를 소유자의 덱 맨 밑에 놓습니다. 무리 카드의 소유자가 누구인지 잘 기억나지 않는다면, 무리 카드의 앞면을 보고서 소유자가 누군지 확인해도 됩니다."

msgid "The host enemy and all of its swarm cards move, engage, and exhaust as a single entity. (For example, if a host enemy or any of its swarm cards are evaded, all of them exhaust and become disengaged.)"
msgstr "우두머리 적과 그에 딸린 무리 카드는 하나의 개체처럼 이동/교전/소진합니다(예시: 우두머리 적 또는 그에 딸린 아무 무리 카드 하나를 회피한다면, 그 무리에 속한 모두를 소진하고 교전이 풀립니다)."

Finally, the Disciple of the Swarm moves to Arkham, as well.</i>\n"

Next, the Hune-Stitched Herald also attacks the Disciple of the Swarm, dealing 3 damage.

"Over a decade after the Great War, another kind of war has come to Earth—a conflict wrought by factions long hidden in the shadows of society.\n"
"It began with the murders in Arkham—over a dozen bodies in half as many days. The police thought the perpetrator to be a serial killer at first, until the sixth victim's corpse turned up as a mangled heap of meat and viscera, like a meal chewed up and spit back out. No human could have performed such a grisly murder.\n"
"When similar killings started to sprout up in other cities across North America, you sought to uncover the truth. A serial killer could not be in Arkham, Providence, Montréal, and New York City all at once. This had to be the work of an organization. But that wasn't all you discovered: there were commonalities between many of the victims, sorting them into three distinct groups.\n"
"In Providence, many victims were older and well-educated. In Montréal, those killed lived in the woods outside the city, or had professions dealings with nature or biology in some capacity. In New York, bodies turned up deep in the sewers and underground subway tunnels, their identities shrouded in mystery.\n"
"You have spent the past few weeks trying to unearth the truth behind these murders and the various factions carrying them out. In this time, the conflict has grown exponentially. Massacres. Bombings. Sightings of strange ceremonies in the streets. Entities blotting out the stars in the night sky. Swarms of locust-like insects devouring people whole. Mutated lizard creatures prowling the sewers. And worse yet, while Arkham seems to be conflict's epicenter, these incidents are spreading all across the world.\n"
"This is no ordinary war, and not one the authorities can deal with. You are the only one who suspects the truth. Somehow, you have to find out what these factions are fighting over, and put a stop to the conflict before it consumes the entire world in its madness."
