"Safe at last, you and the remaining members of the expedition take stock of your situation. You have lost several members of the team, but your members remain strong. Part of you knows that staying any longer would prove foolish or deadly. But a great many questions crowd your thoughts, demanding answers despite your worries. What were those uncanny, Phantasmal creatures? What happened here after Dyer’s expedition left the icy wastes behind?\n"
"You and the others discuss the situation at length and consider various plans. Some believe in the total abandonment of the expedition. But to return empty-handed now would prove disastrous for the university, frustrate the scientific community, and possibly cost the remaining crew their careers. After all, very few believed Dyer’s outlandish claims --who would believe this?\n"
"In the end, you decide to press onward. Another flight is out of the question, of course. That thing in the sky must still be out there. It was a miracle you survived one aeroplane crash, let alone two. No, there’s only one way to reach the site described in Dyer’s report now: you must travel on foot.\n"
"The decision made, you retire to get what meager rest you can before the grueling trek ahead."
