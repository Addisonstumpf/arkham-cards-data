msgid "You find Professor Rice bound and gagged in the closet of his office. When you free him, he informs you that the strange men and women wandering around the campus had been stalking him for hours.

Because the strangers on campus seem to have been targeting Professor Rice, you decide that the best course of action is to escort him away from the campus as quickly as possible.

Oddly, you find no trace of the strange creature—a prospect that worries you more than it relieves you. You hurry to the faculty offices to find Professor Rice, but there is no sign of him anywhere."
