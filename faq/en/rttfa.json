    "text": "- **Q:** [Enraptured](/card/04157) adds 1 charge or secret to an asset you control. Under \"uses\" in the RR, it's pretty clear that you can't add 'charges' to 'ammo' cards or indeed some other variant. But can you add secrets to a card without uses (x secrets) or indeed any other uses thing? **A:** You can technically add secrets to a card that doesn’t have uses, there is nothing in the rules to prevent you from doing that. Normally this won’t help you at all—if you add a secret to a machete, it won’t do anything for you whatsoever—but there exist cards that use secrets even without the uses keyword, such as the untranslated [Archaic Glyphs](/card/03025) and enraptured will surely combo with them! [adding this ruling from Enraptured here for future reference]",
