    "text": "- **Q:** For Mandy Thompson’s [reaction], what does it mean to “resolve 1 additional target of the search?” **A:** Search effects typically instruct you to resolve an effect using the card(s) targeted by the search. For example, if you used an effect to “search the top 3 cards of your deck for a card and draw it,” drawing the searched-for card would be resolving the target of the search. If you used Mandy’s [reaction] here, you could either search the top 6 cards of your deck for a card and draw it, or search the top 3 cards of your deck for 2 cards and draw them both. (You must decide which before initiating the search.) - FAQ, v.1.6, September 2019",

For example, if [Pendant of the Queen](/card/06022) is discarded from play and then shuffled back into your deck and drawn, you would be unable to play it from hand. (Cards that put it directly into play bypassing its cost would be able to put it into play, however.) Cards with a cost of “–” that are played as a copy of a different card, such as [Eidetic Memory](/card/03306), use the resource cost of the copied card, and therefore bypass this restriction. - FAQ, v.1.8, October 2020",

My understanding is that locked door has a permanent ability, not triggered. But we were curious about the fact that locked door prevent any investigating, could read the signs be played if it would allow instead to ignore permanent abilities as well? **A:** You are correct, but there are two reasons why Read the Signs does not interact with Locked Door. The first is that the text on Locked Door that prevents you from investigating is not a triggered ability, it is a constant ability. Read the Signs says “you may ignore any effect or keyword on your location which would trigger during this investigation.” Therefore only triggered abilities (keywords and Forced abilities, for the most part) are ignored. But secondly, Read the Signs only allows you to ignore effects or keywords on the location itself, not on cards attached to the location. Locked Door does not grant any text to its location, it simply reads “The attached location cannot be investigated.” Even if this were a forced ability, Read the Signs would not allow you to ignore it, since it isn’t text on the location, it’s text on a card attached to the location. (This would be different if it said something like “The attached location gains: ‘some forced ability’”)",
